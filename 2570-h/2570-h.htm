      <h3>
        SCENE 1.&mdash;Courtyard and Corridors of the Rancho.
      </h3>
      <p><br />
        MANUELA (arranging supper-table in corridor L., solus). There!
        Tortillas, chocolate, olives, and&mdash;the whiskey of the Americans!
        And supper's ready. But why Don Jose chooses to-night, of all nights,
        with this heretic fog lying over the Mission Hills like a wet serape, to
        take his supper out here, the saints only know. Perhaps it's some
        distrust of his madcap daughter, the Dona Jovita; perhaps to watch her&mdash;who
        knows? And now to find Diego. Ah, here he comes. So! The old story. He
        is getting Dona Jovita's horse ready for another madcap journey. Ah!
        (Retires to table.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter cautiously from corridor, L., SANDY MORTON, carrying lady's saddle
        and blanket; starts on observing MANUELA, and hastily hides saddle and
        blanket in recess.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). She's alone. I reckon the old man's at his siesta yet. Ef
        he'll only hang onto that snooze ten minutes longer, I'll manage to let
        that gal Jovita slip out to that yer fandango, and no questions asked.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (calling SANDY). Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside, without heeding her). That's a sweet voice for a serenade.
        Round, full, high-shouldered, and calkilated to fetch a man every time.
        Only thar ain't, to my sartain knowledge, one o' them chaps within a
        mile of the rancho. (Laughs.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). Oh, go on! That's the style o' them Greasers. They'll
        stand rooted in their tracks, and yell for a chap without knowin'
        whether he's in sight or sound.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (approaching SANDY impatiently). Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (starting, aside). The devil! Why, that's ME she's after.
        (Laughs.) I clean disremembered that when I kem yer I tole those chaps
        my name was James,&mdash;James Smith (laughs), and thet they might call
        me "Jim." And De-a-go's their lingo for Jim. (Aloud.) Well, my beauty,
        De-a-go it is. Now, wot's up?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Eh? no sabe!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Wot's your little game. (Embraces her.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (aside, and recoiling coquettishly). Mother of God! He must be
        drunk again. These Americans have no time for love when they are sober.
        (Aloud and coquettishly.) Let me go, Diego. Don Jose is coming. He has
        sent for you. He takes his supper to-night on the corridor. Listen,
        Diego. He must not see you thus. You have been drinking again. I will
        keep you from him. I will say you are not well.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Couldn't you, my darling, keep him from ME? Couldn't you make him
        think HE was sick? Couldn't you say he's exposin' his precious health by
        sittin' out thar to-night; thet ther's chills and fever in every breath?
        (Aside.) Ef the old Don plants himself in that chair, that gal's chances
        for goin' out to-night is gone up.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Never. He would suspect at once. Listen, Diego. If Don Jose
        does not know that his daughter steals away with you to meet some
        caballero, some LOVER,&mdash;you understand, Diego,&mdash;it is because
        he does not know, or would not SEEM to know, what every one else in the
        rancho knows. Have a care, foolish Diego! If Don Jose is old and blind,
        look you, friend, we are NOT. You understand?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). What the devil does she expect?&mdash;money? No! (Aloud.)
        Look yer, Manuela, you ain't goin' to blow on that young gal! (Putting
        his arm around her waist.) Allowin' that she hez a lover, thar ain't
        nothin' onnateral in thet, bein' a purty sort o' gal. Why, suppose
        somebody should see you and me together like this, and should just let
        on to the old man.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Hush! (Disengaging herself.) Hush! He is coming. Let me go,
        Diego. It is Don Jose!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter Don Jose, who walks gravely to the table, and seats himself.
        MANUELA retires to table.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). I wonder if he saw us. I hope he did: it would shut that
        Manuela's mouth for a month of Sundays. (Laughs.) God forgive me for it!
        I've done a heap of things for that young gal Dona Jovita; but this yer
        gittin' soft on the Greaser maid-servant to help out the misses is a
        little more than Sandy Morton bargained fur.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (to MANUELA). You can retire. Diego will attend me. (Looks at
        DIEGO attentively.) [Exit MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). Diego will attend him! Why, blast his yeller skin, does
        he allow that Sandy Morton hired out as a purty waiter-gal? Because I
        calkilated to feed his horses, it ain't no reason thet my dooty to
        animals don't stop thar. Pass his hash! (Turns to follow MANUELA, but
        stops.) Hello, Sandy! wot are ye doin', eh? You ain't going back on Miss
        Jovita, and jest spile that gal's chances to git out to-night, on'y to
        teach that God-forsaken old gov'ment mule manners? No! I'll humor the
        old man, and keep one eye out for the gal. (Comes to table, and leans
        familiarly over the back of DON JOSE'S chair.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). He seems insulted and annoyed. His manner strengthens
        my worst suspicions. He has not expected this. (Aloud.) Chocolate,
        Diego.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (leaning over table carelessly). Yes, I reckon it's somewhar thar.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). He is unused to menial labor. If I should be right in
        my suspicions! if he really were Dona Jovita's secret lover! This
        gallantry with the servants only a deceit! Bueno! I will watch him.
        (Aloud.) Chocolate, Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). I wonder if the old fool reckons I'll pour it out. Well,
        seein's he's the oldest. (Pours chocolate awkwardly, and spills it on
        the table and DON JOSE.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). He IS embarrassed. I am right. (Aloud.) Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (leaning confidentially over DON JOSE'S chair). Well, old man!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Three months ago my daughter the Dona Jovita picked you up, a
        wandering vagabond, in the streets of the Mission. (Aside.) He does not
        seem ashamed. (Aloud.) She&mdash;she&mdash;ahem! The aguardiente, Diego.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). That means the whiskey. It's wonderful how quick a man
        learns Spanish. (Passes the bottle, fills DON JOSE'S glass, and then his
        own. DON JOSE recoils in astonishment.) I looks toward ye, ole man.
        (Tosses off liquor.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). This familiarity! He IS a gentleman. Bueno! (Aloud.)
        She was thrown from her horse; her skirt caught in the stirrup; she was
        dragged; you saved her life. You&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (interrupting, confidentially drawing a chair to the table, and
        seating himself). Look yer! I'll tell you all about it. It wasn't that
        gal's fault, ole man. The hoss shied at me, lying drunk in a ditch, you
        see; the hoss backed, the surcle broke; it warn't in human natur for her
        to keep her seat, and that gal rides like an angel; but the mustang
        throwed her. Well, I sorter got in the way o' thet hoss, and it stopped.
        Hevin' bin the cause o' the hoss shyin', for I reckon I didn't look much
        like an angel lyin' in that ditch, it was about the only squar thing for
        me to waltz in and help the gal. Thar, thet's about the way the thing
        pints. Now, don't you go and hold that agin her!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Well, well! She was grateful. She has a strange fondness for
        you Americans; and at her solicitation I gave you&mdash;YOU, an unknown
        vagrant&mdash;employment here as groom. You comprehend, Diego. I, Don
        Jose Castro, proprietor of this rancho, with an hundred idle vaqueros on
        my hands,&mdash;I made a place for you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (meditatively). Umph.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. You said you would reform. How have you kept your word? You
        were drunk last Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Thet's so.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. And again last Saturday.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (slowly). Look yer, ole man, don't ye be too hard on me: that was
        the same old drunk.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. I am in no mood for trifling. Hark ye, friend Diego. You have
        seen, perhaps,&mdash;who has not?&mdash;that I am a fond, an indulgent
        father. But even my consideration for my daughter's strange tastes and
        follies has its limit. Your conduct is a disgrace to the rancho. You
        must go.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (meditatively). Well, I reckon, perhaps I'd better.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). His coolness is suspicious. Can it be that he expects
        the girl will follow him? Mother of God! perhaps it has been already
        planned between them. Good! Thank Heaven I can end it here. (Aloud.)
        Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Old man.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. For my daughter's sake, you understand,&mdash;for her sake,&mdash;I
        am willing to try you once more. Hark ye! My daughter is young, foolish,
        and romantic. I have reason to believe, from her conduct lately, that
        she has contracted an intimacy with some Americano, and that in her
        ignorance, her foolishness, she has allowed that man to believe that he
        might aspire to her hand. Good! Now listen to me. You shall stay in her
        service. You shall find out,&mdash;you are in her confidence,&mdash;you
        shall find out this American, this adventurer, this lover if you please,
        of the Dona Jovita my daughter; and you will tell him this,&mdash;you
        will tell him that a union with him is impossible, forbidden; that the
        hour she attempts it, without my consent, she is PENNILESS; that this
        estate, this rancho, passes into the hands of the Holy Church, where
        even your laws cannot reach it.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (leaning familiarly over the table). But suppose that he sees that
        little bluff, and calls ye.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. I do not comprehend you (coldly).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Suppose he loves that gal, and will take her as she stands,
        without a cent, or hide or hair of yer old cattle.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (scornfully). Suppose&mdash;a miracle! Hark ye, Diego! It is
        now five years since I have known your countrymen, these smart
        Americanos. I have yet to know when love, sentiment, friendship, was
        worth any more than a money value in your market.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (truculently and drunkenly). You hev, hev ye? Well, look yar, ole
        man. Suppose I REFUSE. Suppose I'd rather go than act as a spy on that
        young gal your darter! Suppose that&mdash;hic&mdash;allowin' she's my
        friend, I'd rather starve in the gutters of the Mission than stand
        between her and the man she fancies. Hey? Suppose I would&mdash;damn me!
        Suppose I'd see you and your derned old rancho in&mdash;t'other place&mdash;hic&mdash;damn
        me. You hear me, ole man! That's the kind o' man I am&mdash;damn me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside, rising contemptuously). It is as I suspected. Traitor.
        Ingrate! Satisfied that his scheme has failed, he is ready to abandon
        her. And this&mdash;THIS is the man for whom she has been ready to
        sacrifice everything,&mdash;her home, her father! (Aloud, coldly.) Be it
        so, Diego: you shall go.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (soberly and seriously, after a pause.) Well, I reckon I had
        better. (Rising.) I've a few duds, old man, to put up. It won't take me
        long. (Goes to L., and pauses.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). Ah! he hesitates! He is changing his mind. (SANDY
        returns slowly to table, pours out glass of liquor, nods to DON JOSE,
        and drinks.) I looks towards ye, ole man. Adios!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit SANDY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. His coolness is perfect. If these Americans are cayotes in
        their advances, they are lions in retreat! Bueno! I begin to respect
        him. But it will be just as well to set Concho to track him to the
        Mission; and I will see that he leaves the rancho alone.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit Jose.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter hurriedly JOVITA CASTRO, in riding habit, with whip.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        So! Chiquita not yet saddled, and that spy Concho haunting the plains
        for the last half-hour. What an air of mystery! Something awful,
        something deliciously dreadful, has happened! Either my amiable drunkard
        has forgotten to despatch Concho on his usual fool's errand, or he is
        himself lying helpless in some ditch. Was there ever a girl so
        persecuted? With a father wrapped in mystery, a lover nameless and
        shrouded in the obscurity of some Olympian height, and her only
        confidant and messenger a Bacchus instead of a Mercury! Heigh ho! And in
        another hour Don Juan&mdash;he told me I might call him John&mdash;will
        be waiting for me outside the convent wall! What if Diego fails me? To
        go there alone would be madness! Who else would be as charmingly
        unconscious and inattentive as this American vagabond! (Goes to L.) Ah,
        my saddle and blanket hidden! He HAS been interrupted. Some one has been
        watching. This freak of my father's means something. And to-night, of
        all nights, the night that Oakhurst was to disclose himself, and tell me
        all! What is to be done? Hark! (DIEGO, without, singing.)
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Oh, here's your aguardiente,
         Drink it down!"
</pre>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. It is Diego; and, Mother of God! drunk again!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SANDY, carrying pack, intoxicated; staggers to centre, and,
        observing JOVITA, takes off his hat respectfully.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (shaking him by the shoulders passionately). Diego! How dare you!
        And at such a time!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (with drunken solemnity). Miss Jovita, did ye ever know me to be
        drunk afore at such a time?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. No.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Zachy so. It's abnormal. And it means&mdash;the game's up.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I do not understand. For the love of God, Diego, be plain!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (solemnly and drunkenly). When I say your game's up, I mean the
        old man knows it all. You're blowed upon. Hearken, miss. (Seriously and
        soberly.) Your father knows all that I know; but, as it wasn't my
        business to interfere with, I hev sorter helped along. He knows that you
        meet a stranger, an American, in these rides with me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (passionately). Ingrate! You have not dared to tell him! (Seizing
        him by the collar, and threatening him with the horsewhip.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rising with half-drunken, half-sober solemnity). One minit, miss!
        one minit! Don't ye! don't ye do that! Ef ye forget (and I don't blame
        ye for it), ef ye forget that I'm a man, don't ye, don't ye forget that
        you're a woman! Sit ye down, sit ye down, so! Now, ef ye'll kindly
        remember, miss, I never saw this yer man, yer lover. Ef ye'll recollect,
        miss, whenever you met him, I allers hung back and waited round in the
        mission or in the fields beyond for ye, and allowed ye to hev your own
        way, it bein' no business o' mine. Thar isn't a man on the ranch, who,
        ef he'd had a mind to watch ye, wouldn't hev known more about yer lover
        than I do.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (aside). He speaks truly. He always kept in the background. Even
        Don Juan never knew that I had an attendant until I told him. (Aloud.) I
        made a mistake, Diego. I was hasty. What am I to do? He is waiting for
        me even now.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Well (with drunken gravity), ef ye can't go to him, I reckon it's
        the squar thing for him to come to ye.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Recollect yourself, Diego. Be a man!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Fash jus war I say. Let him be a man, and come to ye here. Let
        him ride up to this ranch like a man, and call out to yer father that
        he'll take ye jist as ye are, without the land. And if the old man
        allows, rather than hev ye marry that stranger, he'll give this yer
        place to the church, why, let him do it, and be damned.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (recoiling, aside). So! That is their plan. Don Jose has worked
        on the fears or the cupidity of this drunken ingrate.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (with drunken submission). Ye was speaking to me, miss. Ef ye'll
        take my advice,&mdash;a drunken man's advice, miss,&mdash;ye'll say to
        that lover of yours, ef he's afeard to come for ye here, to take ye as
        ye stand, he ain't no man for ye. And, ontil he does, ye'll do as the
        ole man says. Fur ef I do say it, miss,&mdash;and thar ain't no love
        lost between us,&mdash;he's a good father to ye. It ain't every day that
        a gal kin afford to swap a father like that, as she DOES KNOW, fur the
        husband that she DON'T! He's a proud old fool, miss; but to ye, to ye,
        he's clar grit all through.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (passionately, aside). Tricked, fooled, like a child! and through
        the means of this treacherous, drunken tool. (Stamping her foot.) Ah! we
        shall see! You are wise, you are wise, Don Jose; but your daughter is
        not a novice, nor a helpless creature of the Holy Church.
        (Passionately.) I'll&mdash;I'll become a Protestant to-morrow!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (unheeding her passion, and becoming more earnest and
        self-possessed). Ef ye hed a father, miss, ez instead o' harkinin' to
        your slightest wish, and surroundin' ye with luxury, hed made your
        infancy a struggle for life among strangers, and your childhood a
        disgrace and a temptation; ef he had left ye with no company but want,
        with no companions but guilt, with no mother but suffering; ef he had
        made your home, this home, so unhappy, so vile, so terrible, so awful,
        that the crowded streets and gutters of a great city was something to
        fly to for relief; ef he had made his presence, his very name,&mdash;your
        name, miss, allowin' it was your father,&mdash;ef he had made that
        presence so hateful, that name so infamous, that exile, that flyin' to
        furrin' parts, that wanderin' among strange folks ez didn't know ye, was
        the only way to make life endurable; and ef he'd given ye,&mdash;I mean
        this good old man Don Jose, miss,&mdash;ef he'd given ye as part of yer
        heritage a taint, a weakness in yer very blood, a fondness for a poison,
        a poison that soothed ye like a vampire bat and sucked yer life-blood
        (seizing her arm) ez it soothed ye; ef this curse that hung over ye
        dragged ye down day by day, till hating him, loathing him, ye saw
        yerself day by day becoming more and more like him, till ye knew that
        his fate was yours, and yours his,&mdash;why then, Miss Jovita (rising
        with an hysterical, drunken laugh), why then, I'd run away with ye
        myself,&mdash;I would, damn me!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (who has been withdrawing from him scornfully). Well acted,
        Diego. Don Jose should have seen his pupil. Trust me, my father will
        reward you. (Aside.) And yet there were tears in his drunken eyes. Bah!
        it is the liquor: he is no longer sane. And, either hypocrite or
        imbecile, he is to be trusted no longer. But where and why is he going?
        (Aloud.) You are leaving us, Diego.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (quietly). Well, the old man and me don't get on together.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (scornfully). Bueno! I see. Then you abandon me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (quickly). To the old man, miss,&mdash;not the young one. (Walks
        to the table, and begins to pour out liquor.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (angrily). You would not dare to talk to me thus if John Oakhurst&mdash;ah!
        (Checking herself.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (drops glass on table, hurries to centre, and seizes DONA JOVITA).
        Eh! Wot name did you say? (Looks at her amazed and bewildered.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (terrified, aside). Mother of God! What have I done? Broken my
        sacred pledge to keep his name secret. No! No! Diego did not hear me!
        Surely this wretched drunkard does not know him. (Aloud.) Nothing. I
        said nothing: I mentioned no name.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (still amazed, frightened, and bewildered, passing his hand over
        his forehead slowly). Ye mentioned no name? Surely. I am wild, crazed.
        Tell me, miss&mdash;ye didn't,&mdash;I know ye didn't, but I thought it
        sounded like it,&mdash;ye didn't mention the name of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;John
        Oakhurst?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (hurriedly). No, of course not! You terrify me, Diego. You are
        wild.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (dropping her hand with a sigh of relief). No, no! In course ye
        didn't. I was wild, miss, wild; this drink has confused me yer.
        (Pointing to his head.) There are times when I hear that name, miss,&mdash;times
        when I see his face. (Sadly.) But it's when I've took too much&mdash;too
        much. I'll drink no more&mdash;no more!&mdash;to-night&mdash;to-night!
        (Drops his head slowly in his hands.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (looking at DIEGO&mdash;aside). Really, I'm feeling very
        uncomfortable. I'd like to ask a question of this maniac. But nonsense!
        Don Juan gave me to understand Oakhurst wasn't his real name; that is,
        he intimated there was something dreadful and mysterious about it that
        mustn't be told,&mdash;something that would frighten people. HOLY
        VIRGIN! it has! Why, this reckless vagabond here is pale and agitated.
        Don Juan shall explain this mystery to-night. But then, how shall I see
        him? Ah, I have it. The night of the last festa, when I could not leave
        the rancho, he begged me to show a light from the flat roof of the upper
        corridor, that he might know I was thinking of him,&mdash;dear fellow!
        He will linger to-night at the Mission; he will see the light; he will
        know that I have not forgotten. He will approach the rancho; I shall
        manage to slip away at midnight to the ruined Mission. I shall&mdash;ah,
        it is my father! Holy Virgin, befriend me now with self-possession.
        (Stands quietly at L., looking toward SANDY, who still remains buried in
        thought, as)&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter DON JOSE; regards his daughter and DIEGO with a sarcastic smile.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). Bueno! It is as I expected,&mdash;an explanation, an
        explosion, a lover's quarrel, an end to romance. From his looks I should
        say she has been teaching the adventurer a lesson. Good! I could embrace
        her. (Crosses to SANDY&mdash;aloud.) You still here!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rising with a start). Yes! I&mdash;a&mdash;I was only taking
        leave of Miss Jovita that hez bin kind to me. She's a good gal, ole man,
        and won't be any the worse when I'm gone.&mdash;Good-by, Miss Jovita
        (extending his hand): I wish ye luck.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (coldly). Adios, friend Diego. (Aside, hurriedly.) You will not
        expose my secret?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). It ain't in me, miss. (To DON JOSE, going.) Adios, ole
        man. (Shouldering his pack.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Adios, friend Diego. (Formally.) May good luck attend you!
        (Aside.) You understand, on your word as&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;A
        GENTLEMAN!&mdash;you have no further communication with this rancho, or
        aught that it contains.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (gravely). I hear ye, ole man. Adios. (Goes to gateway, but pauses
        at table, and begins to fill a glass of aguardiente.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside, looking at his daughter). I could embrace her now. She
        is truly a Castro. (Aloud to JOVITA.) Hark ye, little one! I have news
        that will please you, and&mdash;who knows? perhaps break up the monotony
        of the dull life of the rancho. To-night come to me two famous
        caballeros, Americanos, you understand: they will be here soon, even
        now. Retire, and make ready to receive them. [Exit JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside, looking at SANDY). He lingers. I shall not be satisfied
        until Concho has seen him safely beyond the Mission wall.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter CONCHO.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Two caballeros have dismounted in the corral, and seek the honor
        of Don Jose's presence.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Bueno! (Aside.) Follow that fellow beyond the Mission.
        (Aloud.) Admit the strangers. Did they give their names?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. They did, Don Jose,&mdash;Col. Culpepper Starbottle and the Don
        Alexandro Morton.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (dropping glass of aguardiente, and staggering stupidly to the
        centre, confronting DON JOSE and CONCHO, still holding bottle). Eh! Wot?
        Wot name did you say? (Looks stupidly and amazedly at CONCHO and DON
        JOSE, and then slowly passes his hand over his forehead. Then slowly and
        apologetically.) I axes your pardon, Don Jose, and yours, sir (to
        CONCHO), but I thought ye called me. No!&mdash;that ez&mdash;I mean&mdash;I
        mean&mdash;I'm a little off color here (pointing to his head). I don't
        follow suit&mdash;I&mdash;eh&mdash;eh! Oh!&mdash;ye'll pardon me, sir,
        but thar's names&mdash;perhaps yer darter will remember that I was took
        a bit ago on a name&mdash;thar's names sorter hangin' round me yer
        (pointing to his head), that I thinks I hear&mdash;but bein' drunk&mdash;I
        hopes ye'll excoos me. Adios. (Staggers to gateway, CONCHO following.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (aside). There is something more in this than Don Jose would have
        known. I'll watch Diego, and keep an eye on Miss Jovita too.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Exit, following SANDY, who, in exit, jostles against COL. STARBOTTLE
        entering, who stops and leans exhaustedly at the wall to get his breath;
        following him closely, and oblivious of SANDY MORTON, ALEXANDER MORTON,
        sen. Enter COL. STARBOTTLE and ALEXANDER MORTON, sen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 2.&mdash;The Same.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (entering, to DON JOSE). Overlooking the insult of&mdash;er&mdash;inebriated
        individual, whose menial position in this&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;household
        precludes a demand for personal satisfaction, sir, I believe I have the
        honor of addressing Don Jose Castro. Very good, sir. Permit me, sir, to
        introduce myself as Col. Culpepper Starbottle&mdash;demn me! the legal
        adviser of Mr. Alexander Morton, sen., and I may add, sir, the friend of
        that gentleman, and as such, sir&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;personally&mdash;personally
        responsible.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Alexander Morton (puritanically and lugubriously). As a God-fearing man
        and forgiving Christian, Mr. Castro, I trust you will overlook the
        habitual profanity of the erring but well-meaning man, who, by the
        necessities of my situation, accompanies me. I am the person&mdash;a
        helpless sinner&mdash;mentioned in the letters which I believe have
        preceded me. As a professing member of the Cumberland Presbyterian
        Church, I have ventured, in the interest of works rather than faith, to
        overlook the plain doctrines of the church in claiming sympathy of a
        superstitious Papist.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (interrupting, aside to ALEXANDER MORTON). Ahem! ahem! (Aloud
        to DON JOSE.) My friend's manner, sir, reminds me of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Ram
        Bootgum Sing, first secretary of Turkish legation at Washington in '45;
        most remarkable man&mdash;demn me&mdash;most remarkable&mdash;and warm
        personal friend. Challenged Tod Robinson for putting him next to Hebrew
        banker at dinner, with remark&mdash;demn me&mdash;that they were both
        believers in the profit! he, he! Amusing, perhaps; irreverent,
        certainly. Fought with cimeters. Second pass, Ram divided Tod in two
        pieces&mdash;fact, sir&mdash;just here (pointing) in&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;regions
        of moral emotions. Upper half called to me,&mdash;said to me warningly&mdash;last
        words&mdash;never forget it,&mdash;"Star,"&mdash;always called me Star,&mdash;"Respect
        man's religious convictions." Legs dead; emotion confined to upper part
        of body&mdash;pathetic picture. Ged, sir, something to be remembered!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (with grave Spanish courtesy). You are welcome, gentlemen, to
        the rancho of the Blessed Fisherman. Your letters, with their honorable
        report, are here. Believe me, senores, in your modesty you have
        forgotten to mention your strongest claim to the hospitality of my
        house,&mdash;the royal right of strangers.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. Angels before this have been entertained as strangers, says the
        Good Book; and that, I take it, is your authority for this
        ceremoniousness which else were but lip-service and Papist airs. But I
        am here in the performance of a duty, Mr. Castro,&mdash;the duty of a
        Christian father. I am seeking a prodigal son. I am seeking him in his
        wine-husks and among his harl&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (interrupting). A single moment. (To DON JOSE.) Permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;explain.
        As my friend Mr. Morton states, we are, in fact, at present engaged in&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;quest&mdash;er&mdash;pilgrimage
        that possibly to some, unless deterred by considerations of
        responsibility&mdash;personal responsibility&mdash;sir&mdash;Ged, sir,
        might be looked upon as visionary, enthusiastic, sentimental, fanatical.
        We are seeking a son, or, as my friend tersely and scripturally
        expresses it&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;prodigal son. I say scripturally,
        sir, and tersely, but not, you understand it, literally, nor I may add,
        sir, legally. Ged, sir, as a precedent, I admit we are wrong. To the
        best of my knowledge, sir, the&mdash;er&mdash;Prodigal Son sought his
        own father. To be frank, sir,&mdash;and Ged, sir, if Culpepper
        Starbottle has a fault, it is frankness, sir. As Nelse Buckthorne said
        to me in Nashville, in '47, "You would infer, Col. Starbottle, that I
        equivocate." I replied, "I do, sir; and permit me to add that
        equivocation has all the guilt of a lie, with cowardice superadded." The
        next morning at nine o'clock, Ged, sir, he gasped to me&mdash;he was
        lying on the ground, hole through his left lung just here (illustrating
        with DON JOSE'S coat),&mdash;he gasped, "If you have a merit, Star,
        above others, it is frankness!" his last words, sir,&mdash;demn me....
        To be frank, sir, years ago, in the wild exuberance of youth, the son of
        this gentleman left his&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;boyhood's home,
        owing to an innocent but natural misunderstanding with the legal
        protector of his youth&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (interrupting gravely and demurely). Driven from home by my own
        sinful and then unregenerate hand&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (quickly). One moment, a simple moment. We will not weary you
        with&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;history, or the vagaries of youth. He&mdash;er&mdash;came
        to California in '49. A year ago, touched by&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;parental
        emotion and solicitude, my friend resolved to seek him here. Believing
        that the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;lawlessness of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;untrammelled
        youth and boyish inexperience might have led him into some trifling
        indiscretion, we have sought him successively in hospitals, alms-houses,
        reformatories, State's prisons, lunatic and inebriate asylums, and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;even
        on the monumental inscriptions of the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;country
        churchyards. We have thus far, I grieve to say, although acquiring much
        and valuable information of a varied character and interest, as far as
        the direct matter of our search,&mdash;we have been, I think I may say,
        unsuccessful. Our search has been attended with the&mdash;er&mdash;disbursement
        of some capital under my&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;direction, which,
        though large, represents quite inadequately the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;earnestness
        of our endeavors.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (to DON JOSE). The Dona Jovita is waiting to receive you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (to MORTON). You shall tell me further of your interesting
        pilgrimage hereafter. At present my daughter awaits us to place this
        humble roof at your disposal. I am a widower, Don Alexandro, like
        yourself. When I say that, like you, I have an only child, and that I
        love her, you will understand how earnest is my sympathy. This way,
        gentlemen. (Leading to door in corridor, and awaiting them.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside). Umph! an interview with lovely woman means&mdash;er&mdash;intoxication,
        but&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;no liquor. It's evident that the Don doesn't
        drink. Eh! (Catches sight of table in corridor, and bottle.) Oh, he
        does, but some absurd Spanish formality prevents his doing the polite
        thing before dinner. (Aloud, to DON JOSE.) One moment, sir, one moment.
        If you will&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;pardon the&mdash;er&mdash;seeming
        discourtesy, for which I am, I admit&mdash;or&mdash;personally
        responsible, I will for a few moments enjoy the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;delicious
        air of the courtyard, and the beauties of Nature as displayed in the&mdash;er&mdash;sunset.
        I will&mdash;er&mdash;rejoin you and the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;ladies
        a moment later.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. The house is your own, senor: do as you will. This way, Don
        Alexandro. [Exit, in door L., DON JOSE and MORTON, sen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. "Do as you will." Well, I don't understand Spanish ceremony,
        but that's certainly good English. (Going to table.) Eh! (Smelling
        decanter.) Robinson County whiskey! Umph! I have observed that the
        spirit of American institutions, sir, are already penetrating the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;superstitions
        of&mdash;er&mdash;foreign and effete civilizations. (Pours out glass of
        whiskey, and drinks; pours again, and observes MANUELA watching him
        respectfully.) What the Devil is that girl looking at? Eh! (Puts down
        glass.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (aside). He is fierce and warlike. Mother of God! But he is not
        so awful as that gray-haired caballero, who looks like a fasting St.
        Anthony. And he loves aguardiente: he will pity poor Diego the more.
        (Aloud.) Ahem! Senor. (Courtesies coquettishly.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (aside). Oh, I see. Ged! not a bad-looking girl,&mdash;a
        trifle dark, but Southern, and&mdash;er&mdash;tropical. Ged, Star, Star,
        this won't do, sir; no, sir. The filial affections of Aeneas are not to
        be sacrificed through the blandishments of&mdash;er&mdash;Dodo&mdash;I
        mean a Dido.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. O senor, you are kind, you are good. You are an Americano, one
        of a great nation. You will feel sympathy for a poor young man,&mdash;a
        mere muchacho,&mdash;one of your own race, who was a vaquero here,
        senor. He has been sent away from us here disgraced, alone, hungry,
        perhaps penniless. (Wipes her eyes.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. The Devil! Another prodigal. (Aloud.) My dear, the case
        you have just stated would appear to be the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;normal
        condition of the&mdash;er&mdash;youth of America. But why was he
        discharged? (Pouring out liquor.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (demurely glancing at the colonel). He was drunk, senor.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (potently). Drunkenness, my child, which is&mdash;er&mdash;weakness
        in the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman, in the subordinate is a crime.
        What&mdash;er&mdash;excites the social impulse and exhilarates the fancy
        of the&mdash;er&mdash;master of the house, in the performance of his
        duty, renders the servant unfit for his. Legally it is a breach of
        contract. I should give it as my opinion,&mdash;for which I am
        personally responsible,&mdash;that your friend Diego could not recover.
        Ged! (Aside.) I wonder if this scapegoat could be our black sheep.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. But that was not all, senor. It was an excuse only. He was sent
        away for helping our young lady to a cavalier. He was discharged because
        he would not be a traitor to her. He was sent away because he was too
        good, too honorable,&mdash;too&mdash; (Bursts out crying.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside). Oh, the Devil! THIS is no Sandy Morton. (Coming
        forward gravely.) I have never yet analyzed the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;character
        of the young gentleman I have the honor to assist in restoring to his
        family and society; but judging&mdash;er&mdash;calmly&mdash;er&mdash;dispassionately,
        my knowledge of his own father&mdash;from what the old gentleman must
        have been in his unregenerate state, and knowing what he is now in his
        present reformed Christian condition, I should say calmly and
        deliberately that the son must be the most infernal and accomplished
        villain unhung. Ged, I have a thought, an inspiration. (To MANUELA,
        tapping her under the chin.) I see, my dear; a lover, ha, ha! Ah, you
        rogue! Well, well, we will talk of this again. I will&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;interest
        myself in this Diego. [Exit MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (solus). How would it do to get up a prodigal? Umph.
        Something must be done soon: the old man grows languid in his search. My
        position as a sinecure is&mdash;er&mdash;in peril. A prodigal ready
        made! But could I get a scoundrel bad enough to satisfy the old man?
        Ged, that's serious. Let me see: he admits that he is unable to
        recognize his own son in face, features, manner, or speech. Good! If I
        could pick up some rascal whose&mdash;er&mdash;irregularities didn't
        quite fill the bill, and could say&mdash;Ged!&mdash;that he was
        reforming. Reforming! Ged, Star! That very defect would show the
        hereditary taint, demn me! I must think of this seriously. Ged, Star!
        the idea is&mdash;an inspiration of humanity and virtue. Who knows? it
        might be the saving of the vagabond,&mdash;a crown of glory to the old
        man's age. Inspiration, did I say? Ged, Star, it's a DUTY,&mdash;a
        sacred, solemn duty, for which you are responsible,&mdash;personally
        responsible.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Lights down half. Enter from corridor L., MORTON, DON JOSE, the DONA
        JOVITA, and MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita (stepping forward with exaggerated Spanish courtesy). A
        thousand graces await your Excellency, Commander Don&mdash;Don&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (bowing to the ground with equal delight and exaggerated
        courtesy). Er&mdash;Coolpepero!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. Don Culpepero! If we throw ourselves unasked at your
        Excellency's feet (courtesy), if we appear unsought before the light of
        your Excellency's eyes (courtesy), if we err in maidenly decorum in thus
        seeking unbidden your Excellency's presence (courtesy), believe us, it
        is the fear of some greater, some graver indecorum in our conduct that
        has withdrawn your Excellency's person from us since you have graced our
        roof with your company. We know, Senor Commander, how superior are the
        charms of the American ladies. It is in no spirit of rivalry with them,
        but to show&mdash;Mother of God!&mdash;that we are not absolutely ugly,
        that we intrude upon your Excellency's solitude. (Aside.) I shall need
        the old fool, and shall use him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (who has been bowing and saluting with equal
        extravagance, during this speech&mdash;aside). Ged! she IS beautiful!
        (Aloud.) Permit me er&mdash;er&mdash;Dona Jovita, to correct&mdash;Ged,
        I must say it, correct erroneous statements. The man who should&mdash;er&mdash;utter
        in my presence remarks disparaging those&mdash;er&mdash;charms it is my
        privilege to behold, I should hold responsible,&mdash;Ged! personally
        responsible. You&mdash;er&mdash;remind me of er&mdash;incident, trifling
        perhaps, but pleasing, Charleston in '52,&mdash;a reception at John C.
        Calhoun's. A lady, one of the demnedest beautiful women you ever saw,
        said to me, "Star!"&mdash;she always called me Star,&mdash;"you've
        avoided me, you have, Star! I fear you are no longer my friend."&mdash;"Your
        friend, madam," I said. "No, I've avoided you because I am your lover."
        Ged, Miss Jovita, a fact&mdash;demn me. Sensation. Husband heard garbled
        report. He was old friend, but jealous, rash, indiscreet. Fell at first
        fire&mdash;umph&mdash;January 5th. Lady&mdash;beautiful woman&mdash;never
        forgave: went into convent. Sad affair. And all a mistake&mdash;demn me,&mdash;all
        a mistake, through perhaps extravagant gallantry and compliment. I
        lingered here, oblivious perhaps of&mdash;er&mdash;beauty, in the
        enjoyment of Nature.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. Is there enough for your Excellency to share with me, since
        it must be my rival? See, the fog is clearing away: we shall have
        moonlight. (DON JOSE and MORTON seat themselves at table.) Shall we not
        let these venerable caballeros enjoy their confidences and experiences
        together? (Aside.) Don Jose watches me like a fox, does not intend to
        lose sight of me. How shall I show the light three times from the
        courtyard roof? I have it! (Takes STARBOTTLE'S arm.) It is too pleasant
        to withdraw. There is a view from the courtyard wall your Excellency
        should see. Will you accompany me? The ascent is easy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (bowing). I will ascend, although, permit me to say, Dona
        Jovita, it would be&mdash;er&mdash;impossible for me to be nearer&mdash;er&mdash;heaven,
        than&mdash;er&mdash;at present.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. FLATTERER! Come, you shall tell me about this sad lady who
        died. Ah, Don Culpepero, let me hope all your experiences will not be so
        fatal to us!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exeunt DONA JOVITA and STARBOTTLE.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (aside). A froward daughter of Baal, and, if I mistake not, even
        now concocting mischief for this foolish, indulgent, stiff-necked
        father. (Aloud.) Your only daughter, I presume.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. My darling, Don Alexandro. Motherless from her infancy. A
        little wild, and inclined to gayety, but I hope not seeking for more
        than these walls afford. I have checked her but seldom, Don Alexandro,
        and then I did not let her see my hand on the rein that held her back. I
        do not ask her confidence always: I only want her to know that when the
        time comes it can be given to me without fear.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. Umph!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (leaning forward confidentially). To show that you have not
        intrusted your confidence regarding your wayward son&mdash;whom may the
        saints return to you!&mdash;to unsympathetic or inexperienced ears, I
        will impart a secret. A few weeks ago I detected an innocent intimacy
        between this foolish girl and a vagabond vaquero in my employ. You
        understand, it was on her part romantic, visionary; on his, calculating,
        shrewd, self-interested, for he expected to become my heir. I did not
        lock her up. I did not tax her with it. I humored it. Today I satisfied
        the lover that his investment was not profitable, that a marriage
        without my consent entailed the loss of the property, and then left them
        together. They parted in tears, think you, Don Alexandro? No, but
        mutually hating each other. The romance was over. An American would have
        opposed the girl, have driven her to secrecy, to an elopement perhaps.
        Eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (scornfully). And you believe that they have abandoned their
        plans?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. I am sure&mdash;hush! she is here!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter, on roof of corridor, STARBOTTLE and JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Really, a superb landscape! An admirable view of the&mdash;er&mdash;fog&mdash;rolling
        over the Mission Hills, the plains below, and the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;single
        figure of&mdash;er&mdash;motionless horseman&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita (quickly). Some belated vaquero. Do you smoke, Senor
        Commander?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. At times.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. With me. I will light a cigarette for you: it is the
        custom.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        COL. STARBOTTLE draws match from his pocket, and is about to light, but
        is stopped by DONA JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. Pardon, your Excellency, but we cannot endure your American
        matches. There is a taper in the passage.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        COL. STARBOTTLE brings taper: DONA JOVITA turns to light cigarette, but
        manages to blow out candle.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. I must try your gallantry again. That is once I have
        failed. (Significantly.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        COL. STARBOTTLE relights candle, business, same results.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. I am stupid and nervous to-night. I have failed twice.
        (With emphasis.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        COL. STARBOTTLE repeats business with candle. DONA JOVITA lights
        cigarette, hands it to the colonel.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. Thrice, and I have succeeded. (Blows out candle.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. A thousand thanks! There is a&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;light
        on the plain.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita (hastily). It is the vaqueros returning. My father gives a
        festa to peons in honor of your arrival. There will be a dance. You have
        been patient, Senor Commander: you shall have my hand for a waltz.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter vaqueros, their wives and daughters. A dance, during which the
        "sembi canca" is danced by COL. STARBOTTLE and DONA JOVITA. Business,
        during which the bell of Mission Church, faintly illuminated beyond the
        wall, strikes twelve. Dancers withdraw hurriedly, leaving alone MANUELA,
        DONA JOVITA, COL. STARBOTTLE, DON JOSE, and CONCHO. CONCHO formally
        hands keys to Don Jose.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (delivering keys to MORTON with stately impressiveness). Take
        them, Don Alexandro Morton, and with them all that they unlock for bliss
        or bale. Take them, noble guest, and with them the homage of this
        family,&mdash;to-night, Don Alexandro, your humble servants. Good-night,
        gentlemen. May a thousand angels attend you, O Don Alexandro and Don
        Culpepero!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Dona Jovita. Good-night, Don Alexandro. May your dreams to-night see all
        your wishes fulfilled! Good-night, O Senor Commander. May she you dream
        of be as happy as you!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela and Concho (together). Good-night, O senores and illustrious
        gentlemen! may the Blessed Fisherman watch over you! (Both parties
        retreat into opposite corridors, bowing.)
      </p>
      MANUELA, CONCHO, MORTON, DON JOSE. JOVITA. STARBOTTLE.
      <p><br />
        SCENE 3.&mdash;The same. Stage darkened. Fog passing beyond wall
        outside, and occasionally obscuring moonlit landscape beyond. Enter
        JOVITA softly, from corridor L. Her face is partly hidden by Spanish
        mantilla.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. All quiet at last; and, thanks to much aguardiente, my warlike
        admirer snores peacefully above. Yet I could swear I heard the old
        Puritan's door creak as I descended! Pshaw! What matters! (Goes to
        gateway, and tries gate.) Locked! Carramba! I see it now. Under the
        pretext of reviving the old ceremony, Don Jose has locked the gates, and
        placed me in the custody of his guest. Stay! There is a door leading to
        the corral from the passage by Concho's room. Bueno! Don Jose shall see!
        [Exit R.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter cautiously R. OLD MORTON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. I was not mistaken! It was the skirt of that Jezebel
        daughter that whisked past my door a moment ago, and her figure that
        flitted down that corridor. So! The lover driven out of the house at
        four P. M., and at twelve o'clock at night the young lady trying the
        gate secretly. This may be Spanish resignation and filial submission,
        but it looks very like Yankee disobedience and forwardness. Perhaps it's
        well that the keys are in my pocket. This fond confiding Papist may find
        the heretic American father of some service. (Conceals himself behind
        pillar of corridor.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        After a pause the head of JOHN OAKHURST appears over the wall of
        corridor: he climbs up to roof of corridor, and descends very quietly
        and deliberately to stage.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (dusting his clothing with his handkerchief). I never knew
        before why these Spaniards covered their adobe walls with whitewash.
        (Leans against pillar in shadow.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Re-enter JOVITA, hastily.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. All is lost; the corral door is locked; the key is outside, and
        Concho is gone,&mdash;gone where? Madre di Dios! to discover, perhaps to
        kill him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (approaching her). No.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Juan! (Embracing him.) But how did you get here? This is
        madness!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. As you did not come to the mission, I came to the rancho. I
        found the gate locked&mdash;by the way, is not that a novelty here?&mdash;I
        climbed the wall. But you, Miss Castro, you are trembling! Your little
        hands are cold!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (glancing around). Nothing, nothing! But you are running a
        terrible risk. At any moment we may be discovered.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. I understand you: it would be bad for the discoverer. Never
        fear, I will be patient.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. But I feared that you might meet Concho.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Concho&mdash;Concho&mdash;(meditatively). Let me see,&mdash;tall,
        dark, long in the arm, weighs about one hundred and eighty, and active.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Yes; tell me! You have met him?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Possibly, possibly. Was he a friend of yours?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. No!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. That's better. Are his pursuits here sedentary, or active?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. He is my father's major-domo.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. I see: a sinecure. (Aside.) Well, if he has to lay up for a
        week or two, the rancho won't suffer.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Well?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Well!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (passionately). There, having scaled the wall, at the risk of
        being discovered&mdash;this is all you have to say! (Turning away.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (quietly). Perhaps, Jovita (taking her hand with grave
        earnestness), to a clandestine intimacy like ours there is but one end.
        It is not merely elopement, not merely marriage, it is exposure! Sooner
        or later you and I must face the eyes we now shun. What matters if
        tonight or later?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (quickly). I am ready. It was you who&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. It was I who first demanded secrecy, but it was I who told you
        when we last met that I would tell you why to-night.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I am ready; but hear me, Juan, nothing can change my faith in
        you!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (sadly). You know not what you say. Listen, my child. I am a
        gambler. Not the man who lavishes his fortune at the gaming-table for
        excitement's sake; not the fanatic who stakes his own earnings&mdash;perhaps
        the confided earnings of others&mdash;on a single coup. No, he is the
        man who loses,&mdash;whom the world deplores, pities, and forgives. I am
        the man who wins&mdash;whom the world hates and despises.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I do not understand you, Juan.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. So much the better, perhaps. But you must hear me. I make a
        profession&mdash;an occupation more exacting, more wearying, more
        laborious, than that of your meanest herdsman&mdash;of that which others
        make a dissipation of the senses. And yet, Jovita, there is not the
        meanest vaquero in this ranch, who, playing against me, winning or
        losing, is not held to be my superior. I have no friends&mdash;only
        confederates. Even the woman who dares to pity me must do it in secret.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. But you will abandon this dreadful trade. As the son of the rich
        Don Jose, no one dare scorn you. My father will relent. I am his
        heiress.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. No more, Jovita, no more. If I were the man who could purchase
        the world's respect through a woman's weakness for him, I should not be
        here to-night. I am not here to sue your father's daughter with hopes of
        forgiveness, promises of reformation. Reformation, in a man like me,
        means cowardice or self-interest. (OLD MORTON, becoming excited, leans
        slowly out from the shadow of the pillar listening intently.) I am here
        to take, by force if necessary, a gambler's wife,&mdash;the woman who
        will share my fortunes, my disgrace, my losses; who is willing to leave
        her old life of indulgence, of luxury, of respectability, for mine. You
        are frightened, little dove: compose yourself (soothing her tenderly and
        sadly); you are frightened at the cruel hawk who has chosen you for a
        mate.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). God in heaven! This is like HIM! like me!&mdash;like
        me, before the blessed Lord lifted me into regeneration. If it should
        be! (Leans forward anxiously from pillar.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). Still silent! Poor dove, I can hear her foolish heart
        flutter against mine. Another moment decides our fate. Another moment:
        John Oakhurst and freedom, or Red Gulch and&mdash;she is moving. (To
        JOVITA.) I am harsh, little one, and cold. Perhaps I have had much to
        make me so. But when (with feeling) I first met you; when, lifting my
        eyes to the church-porch, I saw your beautiful face; when, in sheer
        recklessness and bravado, I raised my hat to you; when you&mdash;you,
        Jovita&mdash;lifted your brave eyes to mine, and there, there in the
        sanctuary, returned my salute,&mdash;the salutation of the gambler, the
        outcast, the reprobate,&mdash;then, then I swore that you should be
        mine, if I tore you from the sanctuary. Speak now, Jovita: if it was
        coquetry, speak now; I forgive you: if it was sheer wantonness, speak
        now; I shall spare you: but if&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (throwing herself in his arms). Love, Juan! I am yours, now and
        forever. (Pause.) But you have not told me all. I will go with you
        to-night&mdash;now. I leave behind me all,&mdash;my home, my father, my&mdash;(pause)
        my name. You have forgotten, Juan, you have not told me what I change
        THAT for: you have not told me YOURS.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        OLD MORTON, in eager excitement, leans beyond shadow of pillar.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (embracing her tenderly, with a smile). If I have not told you
        who I am, it was because, darling, it was more important that you should
        know what I am. Now that you know that&mdash;why&mdash;(embarrassedly) I
        have nothing more to tell. I did not wish you to repeat the name of
        Oakhurst&mdash;because&mdash;(aside) how the Devil shall I tell her that
        Oakhurst was my real name, after all, and that I only feared she might
        divulge it?&mdash;(aloud) because&mdash;because&mdash;(determinedly) I
        doubted your ability to keep a secret. My real name is&mdash;(looks up,
        and sees MORTON leaning beyond pillar) is a secret. (Pause, in which
        OAKHURST slowly recovers his coolness.) It will be given to the good
        priest who to-night joins our fate forever, Jovita,&mdash;forever, in
        spite of calumny, opposition, or SPIES! the padre whom we shall reach,
        if enough life remains in your pulse and mine to clasp these hands
        together. (After a pause.) Are you content?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I am.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Then there is not a moment to lose. Retire, and prepare
        yourself for a journey. I will wait here.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I am ready now.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (looking toward pillar). Pardon, my darling: there was a
        bracelet&mdash;a mere trifle&mdash;I once gave you. It is not on your
        wrist. I am a trifle superstitious, perhaps: it was my first gift. Bring
        it with you. I will wait. Go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        OAKHURST watches her exit, lounges indifferently toward gate; when
        opposite pillar, suddenly seizes MORTON by the throat, and drags him
        noiselessly to centre.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (hurriedly). One outcry,&mdash;a single word,&mdash;and it is
        your last. I care not who YOU may be!&mdash;who I am,&mdash;you have
        heard enough to know, at least, that you are in the grip of a desperate
        man. (Keys fall from MORTON'S hand. OAKHURST seizes them.) Silence! on
        your life.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (struggling). You would not dare! I command you&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (dragging him to gateway). Out you must go.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. Stop, I command you. I never turned MY father out of doors!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (gazing at MORTON). It is an OLD man! I release you. Do as you
        will, only remember that that girl is mine forever, that there is no
        power on earth will keep me from her.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. On conditions.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Who are you that make conditions? You are not&mdash;her
        father?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. No but I am YOURS! Alexander Morton, I charge you to hear me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (starting in astonishment; aside). Sandy Morton, my lost
        partner's father! This is fate.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. You are astonished; but I thought so. Ay, you will hear me now!
        I am your father, Alexander Morton, who drove you, a helpless boy, into
        disgrace and misery. I know your shameless life: for twenty years it was
        mine, and worse, until, by the grace of God, I reformed, as you shall. I
        have stopped you in a disgraceful act. Your mother&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;left
        HER house, for MY arms, as wickedly, as wantonly, as shamelessly&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Stop, old man! Stop! Another word (seizing him), and I may
        forget your years.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. But not your blood. No, Alexander Morton, I have come thousands
        of miles for one sacred purpose,&mdash;to save you; and I shall, with
        God's will, do it now. Be it so, on one condition. You shall have this
        girl; but lawfully, openly, with the sanction of Heaven and your
        parents.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). I see a ray of hope. This is Sandy's father; the cold,
        insensate brute, who drove him into exile, the one bitter memory of his
        life. Sandy disappeared, irreclaimable, or living alone, hating
        irrevocably the author of his misery; why should not I&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (continuing). On one condition. Hear me, Alexander Morton. If
        within a year, you, abandoning your evil practices, your wayward life,
        seek to reform beneath my roof, I will make this proud Spanish Don glad
        to accept you as the more than equal of his daughter.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). It would be an easy deception. Sandy has given me the
        details of his early life. At least, before the imposition was
        discovered I shall be&mdash; (Aloud.) I&mdash;I&mdash; (Aside.)
        Perdition! SHE is coming! There is a light moving in the upper chamber.
        Don Jose is awakened. (Aloud.) I&mdash;I&mdash;accept.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton. It is well. Take these keys, open yonder gate, and fly! (As
        OAKHURST hesitates.) Obey me. I will meet your sweetheart, and explain
        all. You will come here at daylight in the morning, and claim
        admittance, not as a vagabond, a housebreaker, but as my son. You
        hesitate. Alexander Morton, I, your father, command you. Go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        OAKHURST goes to the gate, opens it, as the sound of DIEGO'S voice,
        singing in the fog, comes faintly in.
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O yer's your Sandy Morton,
                Drink him down!
     O yer's your Sandy Morton,
                Drink him down!
     O yer's your Sandy Morton,
     For he's drunk, and goin' a-courtin'.
     O yer's your Sandy Morton,
                Drink him down!
</pre>
      <p><br />
        OAKHURST recoils against gate, MORTON hesitates, as window in corridor
        opens, and DON JOSE calls from upper corridor.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Concho! (Pause.) 'Tis that vagabond Diego, lost his way in the
        fog. Strange that Concho should have overlooked him. I will descend.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (to OAKHURST). Do you hear?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Exit OAKHURST through gateway. MORTON closes gate, and returns to
        centre. Enter JOVITA hurriedly.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I have it here. Quick! there is a light in Don Jose's chamber;
        my father is coming down. (Sees MORTON, and screams.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (seizing her.) Hush! for your own sake; for HIS; control
        yourself. He is gone, but he will return. (To JOVITA, still struggling.)
        Hush, I beg, Miss Jovita. I beg, I command you, my daughter. Hush!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (whispering). His voice has changed. What does this mean?
        (Aloud.) Where has he gone? and why are YOU here?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (slowly and seriously). He has left me here to answer the
        unanswered question you asked him. (Enter Don Jose and Col. STARBOTTLE,
        R. and L.) I am here to tell you that I am his father, and that he is
        Alexander Morton.

        ACT II.
      </h2>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 1.&mdash;Red Gulch. Canyon of river, and distant view of Sierras,
        snow-ravined. Schoolhouse of logs in right middle distance. Ledge of
        rocks in centre. On steps of schoolhouse two large bunches of flowers.
        Enter STARBOTTLE, slowly climbing rocks L., panting and exhausted. Seats
        himself on rock, foreground, and wipes his face with his
        pocket-handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. This is evidently the er&mdash;locality. Here are the&mdash;er&mdash;groves
        of Academus&mdash;the heights of er&mdash;Ida! I should say that the
        unwillingness which the&mdash;er&mdash;divine Shakespeare points out in
        the&mdash;er&mdash;"whining schoolboy" is intensified in&mdash;er&mdash;climbing
        this height, and the&mdash;er&mdash;alacrity of his departure must be in
        exact ratio to his gravitation. Good idea. Ged! say it to schoolma'am.
        Wonder what she's like? Humph! the usual thin, weazened, hatchet-faced
        Yankee spinster, with an indecent familiarity with Webster's Dictionary!
        And this is the woman, Star, you're expected to discover, and bring back
        to affluence and plenty. This is the new fanaticism of Mr. Alexander
        Morton, sen. Ged! not satisfied with dragging his prodigal son out of
        merited obscurity, this miserable old lunatic commissions ME to hunt up
        another of his abused relatives; some forty-fifth cousin, whose mother
        he had frozen, beaten, or starved to death! And all this to please his
        prodigal! Ged! if that prodigal hadn't presented himself that morning,
        I'd have picked up&mdash;er&mdash;some&mdash;er&mdash;reduced gentleman&mdash;Ged,
        that knew how to spend the old man's money to better advantage.
        (Musing.) If this schoolmistress were barely good-looking, Star,&mdash;and
        she's sure to have fifty thousand from the old man,&mdash;Ged, you might
        get even with Alexander, sen., for betrothing his prodigal to Dona
        Jovita, in spite of the&mdash;er&mdash;evident preference that the girl
        showed for you. Capital idea! If she's not positively hideous I'll do
        it! Ged! I'll reconnoitre first! (Musing.) I could stand one eye; yes&mdash;er&mdash;single
        eye would not be positively objectionable in the&mdash;er&mdash;present
        experiments of science toward the&mdash;er&mdash;the substitution of
        glass. Red hair, Star, is&mdash;er&mdash;Venetian,&mdash;the beauty of
        Giorgione. (Goes up to schoolhouse window, and looks in.) Too early!
        Seven empty benches; seven desks splashed with ink. The&mdash;er&mdash;rostrum
        of the awful Minerva empty, but&mdash;er&mdash;adorned with flowers,
        nosegays&mdash;demn me! And here, here on the&mdash;er&mdash;very
        threshold (looking down), floral tributes. The&mdash;er&mdash;conceit of
        these New England schoolma'ams, and their&mdash;er&mdash;evident
        Jesuitical influence over the young, is fraught, sir, fraught with&mdash;er&mdash;darkly
        political significance. Eh, Ged! there's a caricature on the blackboard.
        (Laughing.) Ha, ha! Absurd chalk outline of ridiculous fat person.
        Evidently the schoolma'am's admirer. Ged! immensely funny! Ah! boys will
        be boys. Like you, Star, just like you,&mdash;always up to tricks like
        that. A sentence scrawled below the figure seems to be&mdash;er&mdash;explanation.
        Hem! (Takes out eyeglass.) Let's see (reading.) "This is old"&mdash;old&mdash;er&mdash;old&mdash;demme,
        sir!&mdash;"Starbottle!" This is infamous. I haven't been forty-eight
        hours in the place, and to my certain knowledge haven't spoken to a
        child. Ged, sir, it's the&mdash;er&mdash;posting of a libel! The woman,
        the&mdash;er&mdash;female, who permits this kind of thing, should be
        made responsible&mdash;er&mdash;personally responsible. Eh, hush! What
        have we here? (Retires to ledge of rocks.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter MISS MARY L., reading letter.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Strange! Is it all a dream? No! here are the familiar rocks,
        the distant snow-peaks, the schoolhouse, the spring below. An hour ago I
        was the poor schoolmistress of Red Gulch, with no ambition nor hope
        beyond this mountain wall; and now&mdash;oh, it must be a dream! But
        here is the letter. Certainly this is no delusion: it is too plain,
        formal, business-like. (Reads.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        MY DEAR COUSIN&mdash;I address the only surviving child of my cousin
        Mary and her husband John Morris, both deceased. It is my duty as a
        Christian relative to provide you with a home&mdash;to share with you
        that wealth and those blessings that a kind providence has vouchsafed
        me. I am aware that my conduct to your father and mother, while in my
        sinful and unregenerate state, is no warrantee for my present promise;
        but my legal adviser, Col. Starbottle, who is empowered to treat with
        you, will assure you of the sincerity of my intention, and my legal
        ability to perform it. He will conduct you to my house; you will share
        its roof with me and my prodigal son Alexander, now by the grace of God
        restored, and mindful of the error of his ways. I enclose a draft for
        one thousand dollars: if you require more, draw upon me for the same.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Your cousin,
      </p>
      ALEXANDER MORTON, SEN.
      <p><br />
        My mother's cousin&mdash;so! Cousin Alexander! a rich man, and reunited
        to the son he drove into shameful exile. Well! we will see this
        confidential lawyer; and until then&mdash;until then&mdash;why, we are
        the schoolmistress of Red Gulch, and responsible for its youthful
        prodigals. (Going to schoolhouse door.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (stopping to examine flowers). Poor, poor Sandy! Another
        offering, and, as he fondly believes, unknown and anonymous! As if he
        were not visible in every petal and leaf! The mariposa blossom of the
        plain. The snowflower I longed for, from those cool snowdrifts beyond
        the ridge. And I really believe he was sober when he arranged them. Poor
        fellow! I begin to think that the dissipated portion of this community
        are the most interesting. Ah! some one behind the rock,&mdash;Sandy,
        I'll wager. No! a stranger!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (aside, and advancing). If I could make her think I left
        those flowers! (Aloud.) When I state that&mdash;er&mdash;I am perhaps&mdash;er&mdash;stranger&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (interrupting him coldly). You explain, sir, your appearance
        on a spot which the rude courtesy of even this rude miner's camp has
        preserved from intrusion.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (slightly abashed, but recovering himself). Yes&mdash;Ged!&mdash;that
        is, I&mdash;er&mdash;saw you admiring&mdash;er&mdash;tribute&mdash;er&mdash;humble
        tribute of flowers. I am myself passionately devoted to flowers. Ged!
        I've spent hours&mdash;in&mdash;er&mdash;bending over the&mdash;er&mdash;graceful
        sunflower, in&mdash;er&mdash;plucking the timid violet from the
        overhanging but reluctant bough, in collecting the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;fauna&mdash;I
        mean the&mdash;er&mdash;flora&mdash;of this&mdash;er&mdash;district.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (who has been regarding him intently). Permit me to leave you
        in uninterrupted admiration of them. (Handing him flowers.) You will
        have ample time in your journey down the gulch to indulge your
        curiosity!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hands STARBOTTLE flowers, enters schoolhouse, and quietly closes door on
        STARBOTTLE as SANDY MORTON enters cautiously and sheepishly from left.
        SANDY stops in astonishment on observing STARBOTTLE, and remains by wing
        left.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (smelling flowers, and not noticing MISS MARY'S absence).
        Beautiful&mdash;er&mdash;exquisite. (Looking up at closed door.) Ged!
        Most extraordinary disappearance! (Looks around, and discovers SANDY;
        examines him for a moment through his eyeglass, and then, after a pause,
        inflates his chest, turns his back on SANDY, and advances to schoolhouse
        door. SANDY comes quickly, and, as STARBOTTLE raises his cane to rap on
        door, seizes his arm. Both men, regarding each other fixedly, holding
        each other, retreat slowly and cautiously to centre. Then STARBOTTLE
        disengages his arm.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (embarrassedly but determinedly). Look yer, stranger. By the rules
        of this camp, this place is sacred to the schoolma'am and her children.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (with lofty severity). It is! Then&mdash;er&mdash;permit me
        to ask, sir, what YOU are doing here.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (embarrassed, and dropping his head in confusion). I was&mdash;passing.
        There is no school to-day.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Then, sir, Ged! permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;DEMAND&mdash;DEMAND,
        sir&mdash;an apology. You have laid, sir, your hand upon my person&mdash;demn
        me! Not the first time, sir, either; for, if I am not mistaken, you are
        the&mdash;er&mdash;inebriated menial, sir, who two months ago jostled
        me, sir,&mdash;demn me,&mdash;as I entered the rancho of my friend Don
        Jose Castro.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (starting, aside). Don Jose! (Aloud.) Hush, hush! She will hear
        you. No&mdash;that is&mdash;(stops, confused and embarrassed. Aside.)
        She will hear of my disgrace. He will tell her the whole story.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. I shall await your apology one hour. At the end of that
        time, if it is not forthcoming, I shall&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;waive
        your menial antecedents, and expect the&mdash;er&mdash;satisfaction of a
        gentleman. Good-morning, sir. (Turns to schoolhouse.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. No, no: you shall not go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Who will prevent me?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (grappling him). I will. (Appealingly.) Look yer, stranger, don't
        provoke me, I, a desperate man, desperate and crazed with drink,&mdash;don't
        ye, don't ye do it! For God's sake, take your hands off me! Ye don't
        know what ye do. Ah! (Wildly, holding STARBOTTLE firmly, and forcing him
        backward to precipice beyond ledge of rocks.) Hear me. Three years ago,
        in a moment like this, I dragged a man&mdash;my friend&mdash;to this
        precipice. I&mdash;I&mdash;no! no!&mdash;don't anger me now! (Sandy's
        grip on STARBOTTLE relaxes slightly, and his head droops.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (coolly). Permit me to remark, sir, that any reminiscence of
        your&mdash;er&mdash;friend&mdash;or any other man is&mdash;er&mdash;at
        this moment, irrelevant and impertinent. Permit me to point out the&mdash;er&mdash;fact,
        sir, that your hand is pressing heavily, demned heavily, on my shoulder.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (fiercely). You shall not go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (fiercely). Shall not?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Struggle. STARBOTTLE draws derringer from his breast-pocket, and SANDY
        seizes his arm. In this position both parties struggle to ledge of
        rocks, and COL. STARBOTTLE is forced partly over.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (opening schoolhouse door). I thought I heard voices. (Looking
        toward ledge of rocks, where COL. STARBOTTLE and SANDY are partly hidden
        by trees. Both men relax grasp of each other at MISS MARY'S voice.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (aloud and with voice slightly raised, to SANDY). By&mdash;er&mdash;leaning
        over this way a moment, a single moment, you will&mdash;er&mdash;perceive
        the trail I speak of. It follows the canyon to the right. It will bring
        you to&mdash;er&mdash;the settlement in an hour. (To MISS MARY, as if
        observing her for the first time.) I believe I am&mdash;er&mdash;right;
        but, being&mdash;er&mdash;more familiar with the locality, you can
        direct the gentleman better.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SANDY slowly sinks on his knees beside rock, with his face averted from
        schoolhouse, as COL. STARBOTTLE disengages himself, and advances
        jauntily and gallantly to schoolhouse.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. In&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;showing the stranger the&mdash;er&mdash;way,
        I perhaps interrupted our interview. The&mdash;er&mdash;observances of&mdash;er&mdash;civility
        and humanity must not be foregone, even for&mdash;er&mdash;the ladies. I&mdash;er&mdash;believe
        I address Miss Mary Morris. When I&mdash;er&mdash;state that my name is
        Col. Starbottle, charged on mission of&mdash;er&mdash;delicate nature, I
        believe I&mdash;er&mdash;explain MY intrusion.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        MISS MARY bows, and motions to schoolhouse door; COL. STARBOTTLE, bowing
        deeply, enters; but MISS MARY remains standing by door, looking toward
        trees that hide SANDY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). I am sure it was Sandy's voice! But why does he
        conceal himself?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside, rising slowly to his feet, with his back to schoolhouse
        door). Even this conceited bully overcomes me, and shames me with his
        readiness and tact. He was quick to spare her&mdash;a stranger&mdash;the
        spectacle of two angry men. I&mdash;I&mdash;must needs wrangle before
        her very door! Well, well! better out of her sight forever, than an
        object of pity or terror. [Exit slowly, and with downcast eyes, right.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (watching the trail). It WAS Sandy! and this concealment means
        something more than bashfulness. Perhaps the stranger can explain.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Enters schoolhouse, and closes door.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 2.&mdash;The same. Enter CONCHO, lame, cautiously, from R. Pauses
        at R., and then beckons to HOP SING, who follows R.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (impatiently). Well! you saw him?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing. Me see him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. And you recognized him?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing. No shabe likoquize.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (furiously). You knew him, eh? Carramba! You KNEW him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing (slowly and sententiously). Me shabe man you callee Diego. Me
        shabbee Led Gulchee call Sandy. Me shabbee man Poker Flat callee
        Alexandlee Molton. Allee same, John! Allee same!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (rubbing his hands). Bueno! Good John! good John! And you knew he
        was called Alexander Morton? And go on&mdash;good John&mdash;go on!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing. Me plentee washee shirtee&mdash;Melican man Poker Flat. Me
        plentee washee shirt Alexandlee Molton. Always litee, litee on shirt

        finger.) Alexandlee Molton. Melican man tellee me&mdash;shirt say
        Alexandlee Molton&mdash;shabbee?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Bueno! Excellent John. Good John. His linen marked Alexander
        Morton. The proofs are gathering! (crosses to C.)&mdash;the letter I
        found in his pack, addressed to Alexander Morton, Poker Flat, which
        first put me on his track; the story of his wife's infidelity, and her
        flight with his partner to red Gulch, the quarrel and fight that
        separated them, his flight to San Jose, his wanderings to the mission of
        San Carmel, to the rancho of the Holy Fisherman. The record is complete!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing. Alexandlee Molton&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (hurriedly returning to HOP SING). Yes! good John; yes, good John&mdash;go
        on. Alexander Morton&mdash;
      </p>

        Hop Sing. Alexandlee Molton. Me washee shirt, Alexandlee Molton; he no

        John. Forty dollar&mdash;yes. Fifty dollar! Tomorrow, John.

      <p><br />
        Concho. You shall have your money, John; but go now&mdash;you
        comprehend. Carramba! go! (Pushes HOP SING to wing.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing (expostulating). Flowty dozen, hep, John! twenty dollar, John.
        Sabe. Flowty&mdash;twenty&mdash;(gesticulating with fingers).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit HOP SING, pushed off by CONCHO.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. The pagan dolt! But he is important. Ah, if he were wiser, I
        should not rid myself of him so quickly! And now for the schoolmistress,&mdash;the
        sweetheart of Sandy. If these men have not lied, he is in love with her;
        and, if he is, he has told her his secret before now; and she will be
        swift to urge him to his rights. If he has not told her&mdash;umph!
        (laughing) it will not be a DAY&mdash;an HOUR&mdash;before she will find
        out if her lover is Alexander Morton, the rich man's son, or "Sandy,"
        the unknown vagabond. Eh, friend Sandy! It was a woman that locked up
        your secret: it shall be a woman, Madre di Dios! who shall unlock it.
        Ha! (Goes to door of schoolhouse as door opens, and appears COL.
        STARBOTTLE.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (aside). A thousand devils! the lawyer of the old man Morton.
        (Aloud.) Pardon, pardon! I am a stranger. I have lost my way on the
        mountain. I am seeking a trail. Senor, pardon!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside). Another man seeking the road! Ged, I believe he's
        lying too. (Aloud.) It is before you, sir, DOWN,&mdash;down the
        mountain.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. A thousand thanks, senor. (Aside.) Perdition catch him! (Aloud.)
        Thanks, senor. [Exit R.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Ged, I've seen that face before. Ged, it's Castro's
        major-domo. Demn me, but I believe all his domestics have fallen in love
        with the pretty schoolma'am.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter MISS MARY from schoolhouse.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (slowly refolding letter). You are aware, then, of the
        contents of this note; and you are the friend of Alexander Morton, sen.?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Permit me a moment, a single moment, to&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;explain.
        I am Mr. Morton's legal adviser. There is&mdash;er&mdash;sense of&mdash;er&mdash;responsibility,&mdash;er&mdash;personal
        responsibility, about the term "friend," that at the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;present
        moment I am not&mdash;er&mdash;prepared to assume. The substance of the
        letter is before you. I am here to&mdash;er&mdash;express its spirit. I
        am here (with great gallantry) to express the&mdash;er&mdash;yearnings
        of cousinly affection. I am aware&mdash;er&mdash;that OUR conduct,&mdash;if
        I may use the&mdash;er&mdash;the plural of advocacy,&mdash;I am aware
        that&mdash;er&mdash;OUR conduct has not in the past years been of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;exemplary
        character. I am aware that the&mdash;er&mdash;death of our lamented
        cousin, your sainted mother, was&mdash;er&mdash;hastened&mdash;I may&mdash;er&mdash;say&mdash;pre&mdash;cip&mdash;itated&mdash;by
        our&mdash;er&mdash;indiscretion But we are hereto&mdash;er&mdash;confess
        judgment&mdash;with&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;costs.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (interrupting). In other words, your client, my cousin, having
        ruined my father, having turned his own widowed relation out of doors,
        and sent me, her daughter, among strangers to earn her bread; having
        seen my mother sink and die in her struggle to keep her family from
        want,&mdash;this man now seeks to condone his offences&mdash;pardon me,
        sir, if I use your own legal phraseology&mdash;by offering me a home; by
        giving me part of his ill-gotten wealth, the association of his own
        hypocritical self, and the company of his shameless, profligate son&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (interrupting). A moment, Miss Morris,&mdash;a single moment!
        The epithets you have used, the&mdash;er&mdash;vigorous characterization
        of our&mdash;er&mdash;conduct, is&mdash;er&mdash;within the&mdash;er&mdash;strict
        rules of legal advocacy, correct. We are&mdash;er&mdash;rascals! we are&mdash;er&mdash;scoundrels!
        we are&mdash;er&mdash;well, I am not&mdash;er&mdash;prepared to say that
        we are not&mdash;er&mdash;demn me&mdash;hypocrites! But the young man
        you speak of&mdash;our son, whose past life (speaking as Col.
        Starbottle) no one more sincerely deprecates than myself,&mdash;that
        young man has reformed; has been for the past few months a miracle of
        sobriety, decorum, and industry; has taken, thanks to the example of&mdash;er&mdash;friends,
        a position of integrity in his father's business, of filial obedience in
        his father's household; is, in short, a paragon; and, demn me, I doubt
        if he's his father's son.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Enough, sir! You are waiting for my answer. There is no
        reason why it should not be as precise, as brief, and as formal as your
        message. Go to my cousin; say that you saw the person he claims as his
        relation; say that you found her, a poor schoolmistress, in a rude
        mining camp, dependent for her bread on the scant earnings of already
        impoverished men, dependent for her honor on the rude chivalry of
        outcasts and vagabonds; and say that then and there she repudiated your
        kinship, and respectfully declined your invitation.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside). Ged! Star! this is the&mdash;er&mdash;female of your
        species! This is the woman&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;one woman&mdash;for
        whom you are responsible, sir!&mdash;personally responsible!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (coldly). You have my answer, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Permit me&mdash;er&mdash;single moment,&mdash;a single
        moment! Between the er&mdash;present moment, and that of my departure&mdash;there
        is an&mdash;er&mdash;interval of twelve hours. May I, at the close of
        that interval&mdash;again present myself&mdash;without prejudice, for
        your final answer?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (indifferently). As you will, sir. I shall be here.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Permit me. (Takes her hand gallantly.) Your conduct and
        manner, Miss Morris, remind me&mdash;er&mdash;singularly&mdash;of&mdash;er
        beautiful creature&mdash;one of the&mdash;er&mdash;first families.
        (Observing MISS MARY regarding him amusedly, becomes embarrassed.) That
        is&mdash;er&mdash;I mean&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;good morning, Miss
        Morris! (Passes by schoolhouse door, retreating and bowing, and picks up
        flowers from door-step.) Good morning!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Excuse me, Col. Starbottle (with winning politeness), but I
        fear I must rob you of those flowers. I recognize them now as the
        offering of one of my pupils. I fear I must revoke my gift (taking
        flowers from astonished colonel's hand), all except a single one for
        your buttonhole. Have you any choice, or shall I (archly) choose for
        you? Then it shall be this. (Begins to place flowers in buttonhole, COL.
        STARBOTTLE exhibiting extravagant gratitude in dumb show. Business
        prolonged through MISS MARY's speech.) If I am not wrong, colonel, the
        gentleman to whom you so kindly pointed out the road this morning was
        not a stranger to you. Ah! I am right. There, one moment,&mdash;a sprig
        of green, a single leaf, would set off the pink nicely. Here he is known
        only as "Sandy": you know the absurd habits of this camp. Of course he
        has another name. There! (releasing the colonel) it is much prettier
        now.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Ged, madam! The rarest exotic&mdash;the Victoria Regina&mdash;is
        not as&mdash;er&mdash;graceful&mdash;er&mdash;tribute!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. And yet you refuse to satisfy my curiosity?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (with great embarrassment, which at last resolves itself
        into increased dignity of manner). What you ask is&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;impossible!
        You are right: the&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman you allude to is known to me
        under&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;another name. But honor&mdash;Miss Morris,
        honor!&mdash;seals the lips of Col. Starbottle. (Aside.) If she should
        know he was a menial! No. The position of the man you have challenged,
        Star, must be equal to your own. (Aloud.) Anything, Miss Morris, but&mdash;er&mdash;that!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (smiling). Be it so. Adios, Col. Starbottle.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (gallantly). Au revoir, Miss Morris. [Exit,
        impressively, L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. So! Sandy conceals another name, which he withholds from Red
        Gulch. Well! Pshaw! What is that to me? The camp is made up of refugees,&mdash;men
        who perhaps have good reason to hide a name that may be infamous, the
        name that would publish a crime. Nonsense! Crime and Sandy! No, shame
        and guilt do not hide themselves in those honest but occasionally
        somewhat bloodshot eyes. Besides, goodness knows! the poor fellow's
        weakness is palpable enough. No, that is not the reason. It is no guilt
        that keeps his name hidden,&mdash;at least, not his. (Seating herself,
        and arranging flowers in her lap.) Poor Sandy! he must have climbed the
        eastern summit to get this. See, the rosy sunrise still lingers in its
        very petals; the dew is fresh upon it. Dear little mountain baby! I
        really believe that fellow got up before daylight, to climb that giddy
        height and secure its virgin freshness. And to think, in a moment of
        spite, I'd have given it to that bombastic warrior! (Pause.) That was a
        fine offer you refused just now, Miss Mary. Think of it: a home of
        luxury, a position of assured respect and homage; the life I once led,
        with all its difficulties smoothed away, its uncertainty dispelled,&mdash;think
        of it! My poor mother's dream fulfilled,&mdash;I, her daughter, the
        mistress of affluence, the queen of social power! What a temptation! Ah,
        Miss Mary, WAS it a temptation? Was there nothing in your free life here
        that stiffened your courage, that steeled the adamant of your refusal?
        or was it only the memory of your mother's wrongs? Luxury and wealth!
        Could you command a dwelling more charming than this? Position and
        respect! Is not the awful admiration of these lawless men more
        fascinating than the perilous flattery of gentlemen like Col.
        Starbottle? is not the devotion of these outcasts more complimentary
        than the lip-service of perfumed gallantry? (Pause.) It's very odd he
        doesn't come. I wonder if that conceited old fool said anything to him.
        (Rises, and then seats herself, smiling.) He HAS COME. He is dodging in
        and out of the manganita bushes below the spring. I suppose he imagines
        my visitor still here. The bashful fool! If anybody should see him, it
        would be enough to make a petty scandal! I'll give him a talking-to.
        (Pause.) I wonder if the ridiculous fool has gone to sleep in those
        bushes. (Rises.) Well, let him: it will help him to recover his senses
        from last night's dissipation; and you, Miss Mary, it is high time you
        were preparing the lessons for to-morrow. (Goes to schoolhouse, enters
        door, and slams it behind her; after a moment reappears with empty
        bucket.) Of course there's no water, and I am dying of thirst. (Goes
        slowly to left, and pauses embarrassedly and bashfully, presently
        laughs,&mdash;then suddenly frowns, and assumes an appearance of
        indignation.) Miss Mary Morris, have you become such an egregious fool
        that you dare not satisfy the ordinary cravings of human nature, just
        because an idle, dissipated, bashful blockhead&mdash;nonsense! [Exit,
        brandishing pail.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 3.&mdash;The Same.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (A pause. SANDY'S voice, without.) This way, miss: the trail is easier.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (MISS MARY'S voice, without.) Never mind me; look after the bucket.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SANDY, carrying bucket with water, followed by MISS MARY. SANDY
        sets bucket down.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. There, you've spilt half of it. If it had been whiskey, you'd
        have been more careful.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (submissively). Yes, miss.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). "Yes, miss!" The man will drive me crazy with his
        saccharine imbecility. (Aloud.) I believe you would assent to anything,
        even if I said you were&mdash;an impostor!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (amazedly). An impostor, Miss Mary?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Well, I don't know what other term you use in Red Gulch to
        express a man who conceals his real name under another.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (embarrassed, but facing MISS MARY). Has anybody been tellin' ye I
        was an impostor, miss? Has thet derned old fool that I saw ye with&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. "That old fool," as you call him, was too honorable a
        gentleman to disclose your secret, and too loyal a friend to traduce you
        by an epithet. Fear nothing, Mr. "Sandy": if you have limited your
        confidence to ONE friend, it has not been misplaced. But, dear me, don't
        think I wish to penetrate your secret. No. The little I learned was
        accidental. Besides, his business was with me: perhaps, as his friend,
        you already know it.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (meekly). Perhaps, miss, he was too honorable a gentleman to
        disclose YOUR secret. His business was with me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). He has taken a leaf out of my book! He is not so
        stupid, after all. (Aloud.) I have no secret. Col. Starbottle came here
        to make me an offer.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (recoiling). An offer!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Of a home and independence. (Aside.) Poor fellow! how pale he
        looks! (Aloud.) Well, you see, I am more trustful than you. I will tell
        you MY secret; and you shall aid me with your counsel. (They sit on
        ledge of rocks.) Listen! My mother had a cousin once,&mdash;a cousin
        cruel, cowardly, selfish, and dissolute. She loved him, as women are apt
        to love such men,&mdash;loved him so that she beguiled her own husband
        to trust his fortunes in the hands of this wretched profligate. The
        husband was ruined, disgraced. The wife sought her cousin for help for
        her necessities. He met her with insult, and proposed that she should
        fly with him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. One moment, miss: it wasn't his pardner&mdash;his pardner's wife&mdash;eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (impatiently). It was the helpless wife of his own blood, I
        tell you. The husband died broken-hearted. The wife, my mother,
        struggled in poverty, under the shadow of a proud name, to give me an
        education, and died while I was still a girl. To-day this cousin,&mdash;this
        more than murderer of my parents,&mdash;old, rich, self-satisfied,
        REFORMED, invites me, by virtue of that kinship he violated and
        despised, to his home, his wealth, his&mdash;his family roof-tree! The
        man you saw was his agent.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. And you&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Refused.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (passing his hand over his forehead). You did wrong, Miss Mary.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Wrong, sir? (Rising.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (humbly but firmly). Sit ye down, Miss Mary. It ain't for ye to
        throw your bright young life away yer in this place. It ain't for such
        as ye to soil your fair young hands by raking in the ashes to stir up
        the dead embers of a family wrong. It ain't for ye&mdash;ye'll pardon
        me, Miss Mary, for sayin' it&mdash;it ain't for ye to allow when it's
        TOO LATE fur a man to reform, or to go back of his reformation. Don't ye
        do it, miss, fur God's sake,&mdash;don't ye do it! Harkin, Miss Mary. If
        ye'll take my advice&mdash;a fool's advice, maybe&mdash;ye'll go. And
        when I tell ye that that advice, if ye take it, will take the sunshine
        out of these hills, the color off them trees, the freshness outer them
        flowers, the heart's-blood outer me,&mdash;ye'll know that I ain't
        thinkin' o' myself, but of ye. And I wouldn't say this much to ye, Miss
        Mary; but you're goin' away. There's a flower, miss, you're wearin' in
        your bosom,&mdash;a flower I picked at daybreak this morning, five miles
        away in the snow. The wind was blowing chill around it, so that my hands
        that dug for it were stiff and cold; but the roots were warm, Miss Mary,
        as they are now in your bosom. Ye'll keep that flower, Miss Mary, in
        remembrance of my love for ye, that kept warm and blossomed through the
        snow. And, don't start, Miss Mary,&mdash;for ye'll leave behind ye, as I
        did, the snow and rocks through which it bloomed. I axes your parding,
        miss: I'm hurtin' yer feelin's, sure.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (rising with agitation). Nothing,&mdash;nothing; but climbing
        these stupid rocks has made me giddy: that's all. Your arm. (To SANDY
        impatiently). Can't you give me your arm? (SANDY supports MISS MARY
        awkwardly toward schoolhouse. At door MISS MARY pauses.) But if
        reformation is so easy, so acceptable, why have you not profited by it?
        Why have you not reformed? Why have I found you here, a disgraced,
        dissipated, anonymous outcast, whom an honest girl dare not know? Why do
        you presume to preach to me? Have you a father?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Hush, Miss Mary, hush! I had a father. Harkin. All that you have
        suffered from a kinship even so far removed, I have known from the hands
        of one who should have protected me. MY father was&mdash;but no matter.
        You, Miss Mary, came out of your trials like gold from the washing. I
        was only the dirt and gravel to be thrown away. It is too late, Miss
        Mary, too late. My father has never sought me, would turn me from his
        doors had I sought him. Perhaps he is only right.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. But why should he be so different from others? Listen. This
        very cousin whose offer I refused had a son,&mdash;wild, wayward, by all
        report the most degraded of men. It was part of my cousin's reformation
        to save this son, and, if it were possible, snatch him from that
        terrible fate which seemed to be his only inheritance.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (eagerly). Yes, miss.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. To restore him to a regenerated home. With this idea he
        followed his prodigal to California. I, you understand, was only an
        after-thought consequent upon his success. He came to California upon
        this pilgrimage two years ago. He had no recollection, so they tell me,
        by which he could recognize this erring son; and at first his search was
        wild, profitless, and almost hopeless. But by degrees, and with a
        persistency that seemed to increase with his hopelessness, he was
        rewarded by finding some clew to him at&mdash;at&mdash;at&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (excitedly). At Poker Flat?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Ah, perhaps you know the story,&mdash;at Poker Flat. He
        traced him to the Mission of San Carmel.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Yes, miss: go on.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. He was more successful than he deserved, perhaps. He found
        him. I see you know the story.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Found him! Found him! Miss, did you say found him?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Yes, found him. And today Alexander Morton, the reclaimed
        prodigal, is part of the household I am invited to join. So you see, Mr.
        Sandy, there is still hope. What has happened to him is only a promise
        to you. Eh! Mr. Sandy&mdash;what is the matter? Are you ill? Your
        exertion this morning, perhaps. Speak to me! Gracious heavens, he is
        going mad! No! No! Yes&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;it is&mdash;he HAS
        broken his promise: he is drunk again.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rising, excited and confused). Excuse me, miss, I am a little
        onsartain HERE (pointing to his head). I can't&mdash;I disremember&mdash;what
        you said jus' now: ye mentioned the name o' that prodigal that was
        found.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Certainly: compose yourself,&mdash;my cousin's son, Alexander
        Morton. Listen, Sandy, you promised ME, you know, you said for MY sake
        you would not touch a drop. (Enter cautiously toward schoolhouse the
        DUCHESS, stops on observing SANDY, and hides behind rock.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (still bewildered and incoherent). I reckon. Harkin, miss, is that
        thar thing (pointing towards rock where DUCHESS is concealed)&mdash;is
        that a tree, or&mdash;or&mdash;a woman? Is it sorter movin' this way?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (laying her hand on SANDY'S). Recover your senses, for
        Heaven's sake, Sandy,&mdash;for MY sake! It is only a tree.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rising). Then, miss, I've broke my word with ye: I'm drunk.
        P'r'aps I'd better be a-goin' (looking round confusedly) till I'm sober.
        (Going toward L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (seizing his hand). But you'll see me again, Sandy: you'll
        come here&mdash;before&mdash;before&mdash;I go?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Yes, miss,&mdash;before ye go. (Staggers stupidly toward L.
        Aside.) Found him! found Alexander Morton! It's a third time, Sandy, the
        third time: it means&mdash;it means&mdash;you're mad! (Laughs wildly,
        and exit L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (springing to her feet). There is a mystery behind all this,
        Mary Morris, that you&mdash;you&mdash;must discover. That man was NOT
        drunk: he HAD NOT broken his promise to me. What does it all mean? I
        have it. I will accept the offer of this Alexander Morton. I will tell
        him the story of this helpless man, this poor, poor, reckless Sandy.
        With the story of his own son before his eyes, he cannot but interest
        himself in his fate. He is rich: he will aid me in my search for Sandy's
        father, for Sandy's secret. At the worst, I can only follow the advice
        of this wretched man,&mdash;an advice so generous, so kind, so
        self-sacrificing. Ah&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 4.&mdash;The same. Enter the DUCHESS, showily and extravagantly
        dressed. Her manner at first is a mixture of alternate shyness and
        bravado.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. I heerd tell that you was goin' down to 'Frisco to-morrow,
        for your vacation; and I couldn't let ye go till I came to thank ye for
        your kindness to my boy,&mdash;little Tommy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside. Rising abstractedly, and recalling herself with an
        effort). I see,&mdash;a poor outcast, the mother of my anonymous pupil.
        (Aloud.) Tommy! a good boy,&mdash;a dear, good little boy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Duchess. Thankee, miss, thankee. If I am his mother, thar ain't a
        sweeter, dearer, better boy lives than him. And, if I ain't much as says
        it, thar ain't a sweeter, dearer, angeler teacher than he's got. It
        ain't for you to be complimented by me, miss; it ain't for such as me to
        be comin' here in broad day to do it, either; but I come to ask a favor,&mdash;not
        for me, miss, but for the darling boy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside&mdash;abstractedly). This poor, degraded creature will
        kill me with her wearying gratitude. Sandy will not return, of course,
        while she is here. (Aloud.) Go on. If I can help you or yours, be
        assured I will.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Thankee, miss. You see, thar's no one the boy has any claim
        on but me, and I ain't the proper person to bring him up. I did allow to
        send him to 'Frisco, last year; but when I heerd talk that a schoolma'am
        was comin' up, and you did, and he sorter tuk to ye natril from the
        first, I guess I did well to keep him yer. For, oh, miss, he loves ye so
        much; and, if you could hear him talk in his purty way, ye wouldn't
        refuse him anything.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (with fatigued politeness, and increasing impatience). I see,
        I see: pray go on.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (with quiet persistency). It's natril he should take to ye,
        miss; for his father, when I first knowed him, miss, was a gentleman
        like yourself; and the boy must forget me sooner or later&mdash;and I
        ain't goin' to cry about THAT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (impatiently). Pray tell me how I can serve you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Yes, miss; you see, I came to ask you to take my Tommy,&mdash;God
        bless him for the sweetest, bestest boy that lives!&mdash;to take him
        with you. I've money plenty; and it's all yours and his. Put him in some
        good school, whar ye kin go and see, and sorter help him to&mdash;forget&mdash;-his
        mother. Do with him what you like. The worst you can do will be kindness
        to what he would learn with me. You will: I know you will; won't you?
        You will make him as pure and as good as yourself; and when he has grown
        up, and is a gentleman, you will tell him his father's name,&mdash;the
        name that hasn't passed my lips for years,&mdash;the name of Alexander
        Morton.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). Alexander Morton! The prodigal! Ah, I see,&mdash;the
        ungathered husks of his idle harvest.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. You hesitate, Miss Mary. (Seizing her.) Do not take your
        hand away. You are smiling. God bless you! I know you will take my boy.
        Speak to me, Miss Mary.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aloud). I will take your child. More than that, I will take
        him to his father.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. No, no! for God's sake, no, Miss Mary! He has never seen
        him from his birth: he does not know him. He will disown him. He will
        curse him,&mdash;will curse me!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Why should he? Surely his crime is worse than yours.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Hear me, Miss Mary. (Aside.) How can I tell her? (Aloud.)
        One moment, miss. I was once&mdash;ye may not believe it, miss&mdash;as
        good, as pure, as you. I had a husband, the father of this child. He was
        kind, good, easy, forgiving,&mdash;too good for me, miss, too simple and
        unsuspecting. He was what the world calls a fool, miss: he loved me too
        well,&mdash;the kind o' crime, miss,&mdash;beggin' your pardon, and all
        precepts to the contrairy,&mdash;the one thing that women like me never
        forgives. He had a pardner, miss, that governed him as HE never governed
        me; that held him with the stronger will, and maybe ME too. I was young,
        miss,&mdash;no older than yourself then; and I ran away with him,&mdash;left
        all, and ran away with my husband's pardner. My husband&mdash;nat'rally&mdash;took
        to drink. I axes your pardin', miss; but ye'll see now, allowin' your
        larnin', that Alexander Morton ain't the man as will take my child.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Nonsense. You are wrong. He has reformed; he has been
        restored to his home,&mdash;your child's home, your home if you will but
        claim it. Do not fear: I will make that right.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SANDY slowly and sheepishly, R.; stops on observing the Duchess,
        and stands amazed and motionless.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (observing SANDY&mdash;aside). He HAS returned. Poor fellow!
        How shall I get rid of this woman? (Aloud.) Enough. If you are sincere,
        I will take your child, and, God help me! bring him to his home and
        yours. Are you satisfied?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Thank ye! Thank ye, miss; but&mdash;but thar's a mistake
        somewhar. In course&mdash;it's natural&mdash;ye don't know the father of
        that child, my boy Tommy, under the name o' Alexander Morton. Ye're
        thinking, like as not, of another man. The man I mean lives yer, in this
        camp: they calls him Sandy, miss,&mdash;SANDY!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (after a pause, coming forward passionately). Hush! I have
        given you my answer, be it Alexander Morton or Sandy. Go now: bring me
        the child this evening at my house. I will meet you there. (Leads the
        DUCHESS to wing. The DUCHESS endeavors to fall at her feet.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. God bless you, miss!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (hurriedly embracing her). No more, no more&mdash;but go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit DUCHESS. MISS MARY returns hurriedly to centre, confronting SANDY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (to SANDY, hurriedly and excitedly). You have heard what that
        woman said. I do not ask you under what alias you are known here: I only
        ask a single question.&mdash;Is SHE your wife? are you the father of her
        child?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (sinking upon his knees before her, and covering his face with his
        hands). I am!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Enough! (Taking flower from her bosom.) Here, I give you back
        the flower you gave me this morning. It has faded and died here upon my
        breast. But I shall replace it with your foundling,&mdash;the child of
        that woman, born like that flower in the snow! And I go now, Sandy, and
        leave behind me, as you said this morning, the snow and rocks in which
        it bloomed. Good-by! Farewell, farewell&mdash;forever! (Goes toward
        schoolhouse as&mdash;)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter COL. STARBOTTLE.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (to STARBOTTLE). You are here in season, sir. You must have
        come for an answer to your question. You must first give me one to mine.
        Who is this man (pointing to SANDY), the man you met upon the rocks this
        morning?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Ahem! I am&mdash;er&mdash;now fully prepared and
        responsible, I may say, miss&mdash;er&mdash;personally responsible, to
        answer that question. When you asked it this morning, the ordinary
        courtesy of the&mdash;er&mdash;code of honor threw a&mdash;er&mdash;cloak
        around the&mdash;er&mdash;antecedents of the&mdash;er&mdash;man whom I
        had&mdash;er&mdash;elected by a demand for personal satisfaction, to the
        equality of myself, an&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman! That&mdash;er&mdash;cloak
        is now removed. I have waited six hours for an apology or a&mdash;er&mdash;reply
        to my demand. I am now free to confess that the&mdash;er&mdash;person
        you allude to was first known by me, three months ago, as an inebriated
        menial,&mdash;a groom in the household of my friend Don Jose Castro,&mdash;by
        the&mdash;er&mdash;simple name of "Diego."
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (slowly). I am satisfied. I accept my cousin's invitation.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit slowly, supported by COL. STARBOTTLE, R.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        As STARBOTTLE and MISS MARY exeunt R., CONCHO and HOP SING enter
        cautiously, L. SANDY slowly rises to his feet, passes his hand across
        his forehead, looks around toward exit of STARBOTTLE and MISS MARY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (slowly, but with more calmness of demeanor). Gone, gone&mdash;forever!
        No: I am not mad, nor crazed with drink. My hands no longer tremble.
        There is no confusion here. (Feeling his forehead). I heard them all. It
        was no dream. I heard her every word. Alexander Morton, yes, they spoke
        of Alexander Morton. She is going to him, to my father. She is going&mdash;she,
        Mary, my cousin&mdash;she is going to my father. He has been seeking me&mdash;has
        found&mdash;ah! (Groans.) No, no, Sandy! Be patient, be calm: you are
        not crazy&mdash;no, no, good Sandy, good old boy! Be patient, be
        patient: it is coming, it is coming. Yes, I see: some one has leaped
        into my place; some one has leaped into the old man's arms. Some one
        will creep into HER heart! No! by God! No! I am Alexander Morton. Yes,
        yes! But how, how shall I prove it?&mdash;how? Who (CONCHO steps
        cautiously forward towards SANDY unobserved) will believe the vagabond,
        the outcast&mdash;my God!&mdash;the crazy drunkard?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (advancing, and laying his hand on SANDY). I will!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (staggering back amazedly). You!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Yes,&mdash;I, I,&mdash;Concho! You know me, Diego, you know me,&mdash;Concho,
        the major-domo of the Blessed Innocents. Ha! You know me now. Yes, I
        have come to save you. I have come to make you strong. So&mdash;I have
        come to help you strip the Judas that has stepped into your place,&mdash;the
        sham prodigal that has had the fatted calf and the ring,&mdash;ah! ah!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. You? You do not know me!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Ah! you think, you think, eh? Listen: Since you left I have
        tracked HIM&mdash;THE IMPOSTOR, this Judas, this coyote&mdash;step by
        step, until his tracks crossed yours; and then I sought you out. I know
        all. I found a letter you had dropped; that brought me to Poker Flat.
        Ah, you start! I have seen those who knew you as Alexander Morton. You
        see! Ah, I am wise.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (aside). It is true. (Aloud.) But (suspiciously) why have you done
        this? You, Concho?&mdash;you were not my friend.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. No, but HE is my enemy. Ah, you start! Look at me, Alexander
        Morton, Sandy, Diego! You knew a man, strong, active, like yourself. Eh!
        Look at me now! Look at me, a cripple! Eh! lame and crushed here
        (pointing to his leg), broken and crushed here (pointing to his heart),
        by him,&mdash;the impostor! Listen, Diego. The night I was sent to track
        you from the rancho, he&mdash;this man&mdash;struck me from the wall,
        dashed me to the earth, and made MY BODY, broken and bruised, a
        stepping-stone to leap the wall into your place, Diego,&mdash;into your
        father's heart,&mdash;into my master's home. They found me dead, they
        thought,&mdash;no, not dead, Diego! It was sad, they said,&mdash;unfortunate.
        They nursed me; they talked of money&mdash;eh, Diego!&mdash;money! They
        would have pensioned me to hush scandal&mdash;eh! I was a dog, a
        foreigner, a Greaser! Eh! That is why I am here. No! I love you not,
        Diego; you are of his race; but I hate&mdash;Mother of God!&mdash;I HATE
        him!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rising to his feet, aside). Good! I begin to feel my courage
        return: my nerves are stronger. Courage, Sandy! (Aloud.) Be it so,
        Concho: there is my hand! We will help each other,&mdash;you to my
        birthright, I to your revenge! Hark ye! (SANDY'S manner becomes more
        calm and serious.) This impostor is NO craven, NO coyote. Whoever he is,
        he must be strong. He has most plausible evidences. We must have rigid
        proofs. I will go with you to Poker Flat. There is one man, if he be
        living, knows me better than any man who lives. He has done me wrong,&mdash;a
        great wrong, Concho,&mdash;but I will forgive him. I will do more,&mdash;I
        will ask his forgiveness. He will be a witness no man dare gainsay&mdash;my
        partner&mdash;God help him and forgive him as I do!&mdash;John Oakhurst.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Oakhurst your partner!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (angrily). Yes. Look ye, Concho, he has wronged me in a private
        way: that is MY business, not YOURS; but he was MY partner, no one shall
        abuse him before me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Be it so. Then sink here! Rot here! Go back to your husks, O
        prodigal! wallow in the ditches of this camp, and see your birthright
        sold for a dram of aguardiente! Lie here, dog and coyote that you are,
        with your mistress under the protection of your destroyer! For I tell
        you&mdash;I, Concho, the cripple&mdash;that the man who struck me down,
        the man who stepped into your birthright, the man who to-morrow welcomes
        your sweetheart in his arms, who holds the custody of your child, is
        your partner,&mdash;John Oakhurst.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (who has been sinking under CONCHO'S words, rising convulsively to
        his feet). God be merciful to me a sinner! (Faints.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (standing over his prostrate body exultingly). I am right. You
        are wise, Concho, you are wise! You have found Alexander Morton!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Hop Sing (advancing slowly to SANDY'S side, and extending open palm). Me
        washee shirt flo you, flowty dozen hab. You no payee me. Me wantee
        twenty dollar hep. Sabe!

        ACT III.
      </h2>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 1.&mdash;The bank parlor of Morton &amp; Son, San Francisco. Room
        richly furnished; two square library desks, left and right. At right,
        safe in wall; at left, same with practicable doors. Folding door in flat
        C., leading to counting-room. Door in left to private room of ALEXANDER
        MORTON, sen.; door in right to private room of MORTON, jun. ALEXANDER
        MORTON, sen., discovered at desk R., opening and reading letters.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton, sen. (laying down letter). Well, well, the usual story; letters
        from all sorts of people, who have done or intend to do all sorts of
        things for my reclaimed prodigal. (Reads.) "Dear Sir: five years ago I
        loaned some money to a stranger who answers the description of your
        recovered son. He will remember Jim Parker,&mdash;Limping Jim, of Poker
        Flat. Being at present short of funds, please send twenty dollars,
        amount loaned, by return mail. If not convenient, five dollars will do
        as instalment." Pshaw! (Throws letter aside, and takes up another.)
        "Dear Sir: I invite your attention to enclosed circular for a proposed
        Home for Dissipated and Anonymous Gold-Miners. Your well-known
        reputation for liberality, and your late valuable experience in the
        reformation of your son, will naturally enlist your broadest sympathies.
        We enclose a draft for five thousand dollars, for your signature." We
        shall see! Another: "Dear Sir: the Society for the Formation of Bible
        Classes in the Upper Stanislaus acknowledge your recent munificent gift
        of five hundred dollars to the cause. Last Sabbath Brother Hawkins of
        Poker Flat related with touching effect the story of your prodigal to an
        assemblage of over two hundred miners. Owing to unusual expenses, we
        regret to be compelled to draw upon you for five hundred dollars more."
        So! (Putting down letter.) If we were given to pride and vainglory, we
        might well be puffed up with the fame of our works and the contagion of
        our example: yet I fear that, with the worldly-minded, this praise of
        charity to others is only the prayerful expectation of some personal
        application to the praiser. (Rings hand-bell.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (To JACKSON.) File these letters (handing letters) with the others.
        There is no answer. Has young Mr. Alexander come in yet?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. He only left here an hour ago. It was steamer day yesterday: he
        was up all night, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). True. And the night before he travelled all night,
        riding two hours ahead of one of our defaulting agents, and saved the
        bank a hundred thousand dollars. Certainly his devotion to business is
        unremitting. (Aloud.) Any news from Col. Starbottle?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. He left this note, sir, early this morning.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (takes it, and reads). "I think I may say, on my own personal
        responsibility, that the mission is successful. Miss Morris will arrive
        to-night with a female attendant and child." (To JACKSON.) That is all,
        sir. Stop! Has any one been smoking here?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Not to my knowledge, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. There was a flavor of stale tobacco smoke in the room this
        morning when I entered, and ashes on the carpet. I KNOW that young Mr.
        Alexander has abandoned the pernicious habit. See that it does not occur
        again.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Yes, sir. (Aside.) I must warn Mr. Alexander that his friends
        must be more careful; and yet those ashes were good for a deposit of
        fifty thousand.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Is any one waiting?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Yes, sir,&mdash;Don Jose Castro and Mr. Capper.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Show in the Don: the policeman can wait.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Yes, sir. [Exit.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (taking up STARBOTTLE'S note). "Miss Morris will arrive
        to-night." And yet he saw her only yesterday. This is not like her
        mother: no. She would never have forgiven and forgotten so quickly.
        Perhaps she knew not my sin and her mother's wrongs; perhaps she has&mdash;has&mdash;CHRISTIAN
        forgiveness (sarcastically); perhaps, like my prodigal, she will be
        immaculately perfect. Well, well: at least her presence will make my
        home less lonely. "An attendant and child." A child! Ah, if HE, my boy,
        my Alexander, were still a child, I might warm this cold, cold heart in
        his sunshine! Strange that I cannot reconstruct from this dutiful,
        submissive, obedient, industrious Alexander,&mdash;this redeemed
        outcast, this son who shares my life, my fortunes, my heart,&mdash;the
        foolish, wilful, thoughtless, idle boy, that once defied me. I remember
        (musing, with a smile) how the little rascal, ha, ha! once struck me,&mdash;STRUCK
        ME!&mdash;when I corrected him: ha, ha! (Rubbing his hands with
        amusement, and then suddenly becoming grave and lugubrious.) No, no.
        These are the whisperings of the flesh. Why should I find fault with him
        for being all that a righteous conversion demands,&mdash;all that I
        asked and prayed for? No, Alexander Morton: it is you, YOU, who are not
        yet regenerate. It is YOU who are ungrateful to Him who blessed you, to
        Him whose guiding hand led you to&mdash;

      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Don Jose Castro.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter DON JOSE.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. A thousand pardons, senor, for interrupting you in the hours
        of business; but it is&mdash;it is of business I would speak. (Looking
        around.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (to JACKSON). You can retire. (Exit JACKSON.) Be seated, Mr.
        Castro: I am at your service.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. It is of your&mdash;your son&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Our firm is Morton &amp; Son: in business we are one, Mr.
        Castro.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Bueno! Then to you as to him I will speak. Here is a letter I
        received yesterday. It has significance, importance perhaps. But,
        whatever it is, it is something for you, not me, to know. If I am
        wronged much, Don Alexandro, you, you, are wronged still more. Shall I
        read it? Good. (Reads.) "The man to whom you have affianced your
        daughter is not the son of Alexander Morton. Have a care. If I do not
        prove him an impostor at the end of six days, believe me one, and not
        your true friend and servant, Concho." In six days, Don Alexandro, the
        year of probation is over, and I have promised my daughter's hand to
        your son. (Hands letter to MORTON.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (ringing bell). Is that all, Mr. Castro?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. All, Mr. Castro? Carramba! is it not enough?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (to JACKSON). You have kept a record of this business during
        the last eighteen months. Look at this letter. (Handing letter.) Is the
        handwriting familiar?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson (taking letter). Can't say, sir. The form is the old one.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. How many such letters have you received?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Four hundred and forty-one, sir. This is the four hundred and
        forty-second application for your son's position, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Pardon. This is not an application: it is only information or
        caution.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (to JACKSON). How many letters of information or caution have
        we received?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. This makes seven hundred and eighty-one, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. How, sir! (Quickly.) There were but seven hundred and
        seventy-nine last night.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Beg pardon, sir! The gentleman who carried Mr. Alexander's
        valise from the boat was the seven hundred and eightieth.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Explain yourself, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. He imparted to me, while receiving his stipend, the fact that
        he did not believe young Mr. Alexander was your son. An hour later, sir,
        he also imparted to me confidentially that he believed you were his
        father, and requested the loan of five dollars, to be repaid by you, to
        enable him to purchase a clean shirt, and appear before you in
        respectable condition. He waited for you an hour, and expressed some
        indignation that he had not an equal show with others to throw himself
        into your arms.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (rising, aside, and uplifting his hands). Carramba! These
        Americanos are of the Devil! (Aloud.) Enough, Don Alexandro! Then you
        think this letter is only worth&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. One moment. I can perhaps tell you exactly its market value.
        (To JACKSON.) Go on, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. At half-past ten, sir, then being slightly under the influence
        of liquor, he accepted the price of a deck passage to Stockton.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. How much was that, sir?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Fifty cents.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Exactly so! There you have, sir (to DON JOSE), the market
        value of the information you have received. I would advise you, as a
        business matter, not to pay more. As a business matter, you can at any
        time draw upon us for the amount. (To JACKSON.) Admit Mr. Capper. [Exit
        JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (rising with dignity). This is an insult, Don Alexandro.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. You are wrong, Mr. Castro: it is BUSINESS; sought, I
        believe, by yourself. Now that it is transacted, I beg you to dine with
        me to-morrow to meet my niece. No offence, sir, no offence. Come, come!
        Business, you know, business.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (relaxing). Be it so! I will come. (Aside.) These Americanos,
        these Americanos, are of the Devil! (Aloud.) Adios. (Going.) I hear, by
        report, that you have met with the misfortune of a serious loss by
        robbery?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). So our mishap is known everywhere. (Aloud.) No
        serious misfortune, Mr. Castro, even if we do not recover the money.
        Adios.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit Don Jose.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. The stiff-necked Papist! That he should dare, for the sake
        of his black-browed, froward daughter, to&mdash;question the faith on
        which I have pinned my future! Well, with God's blessing, I gave him
        some wholesome discipline. If it were not for my covenant with Alexander&mdash;and
        nobly he has fulfilled his part,&mdash;I should forbid his alliance with
        the blood of this spying Jesuit.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter Mr. JACKSON, leading in CAPPER.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Policeman, sir. [Exit.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (turning sharply). Who's that man?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Jackson, clerk.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Umph! Been here long?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. A year. He was appointed by my son.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Know anything of his previous life?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (stiffly). I have already told you he is an appointee of my
        son's.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Yes! (Aside.) "Like master, like man." (Aloud.) Well, to
        business. We have worked up the robbery. We have reached two
        conclusions,&mdash;one, that the work was not done by professionals; the
        other, consequent upon this, that you can't recover the money.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Excuse me, sir, but I do not see the last conclusion.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Then listen. The professional thief has only one or two ways of
        disposing of his plunder, and these ways are always well known to us.
        Good! Your stolen coin has not been disposed of in the regular way,
        through the usual hands which we could at any time seize. Of this we are
        satisfied.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. How do you know it?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. In this way. The only clew we have to the identification of the
        missing money were two boxes of Mexican doubloons.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). Mr. Castro's special deposit! He may have reason for
        his interest. (Aloud.) Go on.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. It is a coin rare in circulation in the interior. The night
        after the robbery, the dealer of a monte-table in Sacramento paid out
        five thousand dollars in doubloons. He declared it was taken in at the
        table, and could not identify the players. Of course, OF COURSE! So far,
        you see, you are helpless. We have only established one fact, that the
        robber is&mdash;is&mdash;(significantly) a gambler.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (quietly). The regular trade of the thief seems to me to be
        of little importance if you cannot identify him, or recover my money.
        But go on, sir, go on: or is this all?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (aside). The old fool is blind. That is natural. (Aloud.) It is
        not all. The crime will doubtless be repeated. The man who has access to
        your vaults, who has taken only thirty thousand dollars when he could
        have secured half a million,&mdash;this man, who has already gambled
        that thirty thousand away,&mdash;will not stop there. He will in a day
        or two, perhaps to-day, try to retrieve his losses out of YOUR capital.
        I am here to prevent it.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (becoming interested). How?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Give me, for forty-eight hours, free access to this building.
        Let me conceal myself somewhere, anywhere, within these walls. Let it be
        without the knowledge of your clerks, even of YOUR SON!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (proudly). Mr. Alexander Morton is absent to-day. There is no
        other reason why he should not be here to consent to the acts of his
        partner and father.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (quickly). Very good. It is only to insure absolute secrecy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). Another robbery might excite a suspicion, worse for
        our credit than our actual loss. There is a significant earnestness
        about this man, that awakens my fears. If Alexander were only here.
        (Aloud.) I accept. (CAPPER has been trying doors R. and L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. What room is this? (At R.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. My son's: I would prefer&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. And this? (At L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Mine, sir; if you choose&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (locking door, and putting key in his pocket). This will do.
        Oblige me by making the necessary arrangements in your counting-room.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (hesitating and aside). He is right: perhaps it is only
        prudence, and I am saving Alexander additional care and annoyance.
        [Exit.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter MR. SHADOW cautiously, C.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Shadow (in a lisping whisper to CAPPER). I've got the litht of the
        clerkth complete.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (triumphantly). Put it in your pocket, Shadow. We don't care for
        the lackeys now: we are after the master.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Shadow. Eh! the mathter?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Yes: the master,&mdash;the young master, the reclaimed son, the
        reformed prodigal! ha, ha!&mdash;the young man who compensates himself
        for all this austere devotion to business and principle by dipping into
        the old man's vaults when he wants a pasear: eh, Shadow? That's the man
        we're after. Look here! I never took any stock in that young man's
        reformation. Ye don't teach old sports like him new tricks. They're a
        bad lot, father and son,&mdash;eh, Shadow?&mdash;and he's a chip of the
        old block. I spotted him before this robbery, before we were ever called
        in here professionally. I've had my eye on Alexander Morton, alias John
        Oakhurst; and, when I found the old man's doubloons raked over a
        monte-table at Sacramento, I knew where to look for the thief. Eh,
        Shadow?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Shadow (aside). He ith enormouth, thith Mithter Capper.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter OLD MORTON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. I have arranged everything. You will not be disturbed or
        suspected here in my private office. Eh! (Looking at SHADOW.) Who has
        slipped in here?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Only my Shadow, Mr. Morton; but I can rid myself even of that.
        (Crosses to SHADOW.) Take this card to the office, and wait for further
        orders. Vanish, Shadow! [Exit SHADOW.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Mr. Alexander has come in, sir. (OLD MORTON and CAPPER start.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Where is he?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. In his private room, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Enough: you can go.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (crossing to MORTON). Remember, you have given your pledge of
        secrecy. Beware! Your honor, your property, the credit and reputation of
        your bank, are at stake.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (after a pause of hesitation, with dignity). I gave you my
        word, sir, while my son was not present. I shall save myself from
        breaking my word with you, or concealing anything from him, by
        withdrawing myself. For the next twenty-four hours, this room (pointing
        to private room R.) is yours.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Each regards the other. Exit OLD MORTON C., as CAPPER exit in private
        room R. After a pause, door of room L. opens, and HARRY YORK appears,
        slightly intoxicated, followed by JOHN OAKHURST.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Harry York (looking around). By Jove! Morton, but you've got things in
        style here. And this yer's the gov'nor's desk; and here old Praise god
        Barebones sits opposite ye. Look yer, old boy (throwing himself in
        chair), I kin allow how it comes easy for ye to run this bank, for it's
        about as exciting, these times, as faro was to ye in '49, when I first
        knew ye as Jack Oakhurst; but how the Devil you can sit opposite that
        stiff embodiment of all the Ten Commandments, day by day, damn it!
        that's wot GETS me! Why, the first day I came here on business, the old
        man froze me so that I couldn't thaw a deposit out of my pocket. It
        chills me to think of it.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (hastily). I suppose I am accustomed to him. But come, Harry:
        let me warm you. (Opens door of safe L., and discovers cupboard,
        decanter, and glasses.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York (laughing). By Jove! under the old man's very nose. Jack, this is
        like you. (Takes a drink.) Well, old boy, this is like old times. But
        you don't drink?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. No, nor smoke. The fact is, Harry, I've taken a year's pledge.
        I've six days still to run; after that (gloomily), why (with a reckless
        laugh), I shall be Jack Oakhurst again.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York. Lord! to think of your turning out to be anybody's son, Jack!&mdash;least
        of all, HIS! (Pointing to chair.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (laughing recklessly). Not more strange than that I should find
        Harry York, the spendthrift of Poker Flat, the rich and respected Mr.
        York, produce merchant of San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York. Yes; but, my boy, you see I didn't strike it&mdash;in a rich
        father. I gave up gambling, married, and settled down, saved my money,
        invested a little here and there, and&mdash;worked for it, Jack, damn
        me,&mdash;worked for it like a damned horse!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). True, this is not work.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York. But that ain't my business with ye now, old boy: it's this. You've
        had some trials and troubles in the bank lately,&mdash;a defalcation of
        agents one day, a robbery next. It's luck, my boy, luck! but ye know
        people will talk. You don't mind my sayin' that there's rumors 'round.
        The old man's mighty unpopular because he's a saint; and folks don't
        entirely fancy you because you used to be the reverse. Well, Jack, it
        amounts to 'bout this: I've withdrawn my account from Parkinson's, in
        Sacramento, and I've got a pretty heavy balance on hand&mdash;nigh on
        two hundred thousand&mdash;in bonds and certificates here; and if it
        will help you over the rough places, old boy, as a deposit, yer it is
        (drawing pocket-book.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (greatly affected, but endeavoring to conceal it). Thank you,
        Harry, old fellow&mdash;but&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York (quickly). I know: I'll take the risk, a business risk. You'll
        stand by me all you can, old boy; you'll make it pay all you can; and if
        you lose it&mdash;why&mdash;all right!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (embarrassed). As a deposit with Morton &amp; Son, drawing two
        per cent monthly interest&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York. Damn Morton &amp; Son! I'll back it with Jack Oakhurst, the man I
        know.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (advancing slowly). I'll take it, Harry.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York (extending his hand). It's a square game, Jack!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (seizing his hand with repressed emotion). It's a square game,
        Harry York, if I live.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        York. Then I'll travel. Good-night, old boy. I'll send my clerk around
        in the morning to put things right. Good-night (going).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (grasping YORK'S hand). One moment&mdash;no&mdash;nothing!
        Good-night. [Exit YORK.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        OAKHURST follows him to door, and then returns to desk, throwing himself
        in chair, and burying his face in his hands.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (with deep feeling). It needed but this to fill the measure of
        my degradation. I have borne the suspicions of the old man's enemies,
        the half-pitying, half-contemptuous sympathy of his friends, even his
        own cold, heartless, fanatical fulfilment of his sense of duty; but THIS&mdash;this
        confidence from one who had most reason to scorn me, this trust from one
        who knew me as I WAS,&mdash;this is the hardest burden. And he, too, in
        time will know me to be an impostor. He too&mdash;a reformed man; but he
        has honorably retraced his steps, and won the position I hold by a
        trick, an imposture. And what is all my labor beside his honest
        sincerity? I have fought against the chances that might discover my
        deception, against the enemies who would overthrow me, against the fate
        that put me here; and I have been successful&mdash;yes, a successful
        impostor! I have even fought against the human instinct that told this
        fierce, foolish old man that I was an alien to his house, to his blood;
        I have even felt him scan my face eagerly for some reflection of his
        long-lost boy, for some realization of his dream; and I have seen him
        turn away, cold, heartsick, and despairing. What matters that I have
        been to him devoted, untiring, submissive, ay, a better son to him than
        his own weak flesh and blood would have been? He would to-morrow cast me
        forth to welcome the outcast, Sandy Morton. Well, what matters?
        (Recklessly.) Nothing. In six days it will be over; in six days the year
        of my probation will have passed; in six days I will disclose to him the
        deceit I have practised, and will face the world again as John Oakhurst,
        the gambler, who staked and lost ALL on a single cast. And Jovita! Well,
        well!&mdash;the game is made: it is too late to draw out now. (Rings
        bell. Enter JACKSON.) Who has been here?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Only Don Jose, and Mr. Capper, the detective.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. The detective? What for?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. To work up the robbery, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. True! Capper, Capper, yes! A man of wild and ridiculous
        theories, but well-meaning, brave, and honest. (Aside.) This is the old
        man's idea. He does not know that I was on the trail of the thieves an
        hour before the police were notified. (Aloud.) Well, sir?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. He told your father he thought the recovery of the money
        hopeless, but he came to caution us against a second attempt.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside, starting). True! I had not thought of that.
        (Excitedly.) The success of their first attempt will incite them to
        another; the money they have stolen is gone by this time. (Aloud.)
        Jackson, I will stay here to-night and to-morrow night, and relieve your
        regular watchman. You will, of course, say nothing of my intention.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Yes, sir. (Lingering.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (after a pause). That is all, Mr. Jackson.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Beg your pardon, Mr. Morton; but Col. Starbottle, with two
        ladies, was here half an hour ago, and said they would come again when
        you were alone.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Very well: admit them.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Beg pardon, sir; but they seemed to avoid seeing your father
        until they had seen you. It looked mysterious, and I thought I would
        tell you first.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (laughing). Admit them, Mr. Jackson. (Exit JACKSON.) This poor
        fellow's devotion is increasing. He, too, believes that his old
        associate in dissipation, John Oakhurst, IS the son of Alexander Morton.
        He, too, will have to share in the disgrace of the impostor. Ladies!
        umph! (Looking down at his clothes.) I'm afraid the reform of Alexander
        Morton hasn't improved the usual neatness of John Oakhurst. I haven't
        slept, nor changed my clothes, for three days. (Goes to door of MORTON,
        sen.'s, room.) Locked, and the key on the inside! That's strange.
        Nonsense! the old man has locked his door and gone out through the
        private entrance. Well, I'll find means of making my toilet here. [Exit
        into private room L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON, leading in COL. STARBOTTLE, MISS MARY, the DUCHESS, and
        child of three years.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. Mr. Alexander Morton, jun., is in his private room. He will be
        here in a moment. [Exit JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. One moment, a single moment, Miss Mary. Permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;if
        I may so express myself, to&mdash;er&mdash;group the party, to&mdash;er&mdash;place
        the&mdash;er&mdash;present company into position. I have&mdash;er&mdash;observed
        as part of my&mdash;er&mdash;legal experience, that in cases of moral
        illustration a great, I may say&mdash;er&mdash;tremendous, effect on the&mdash;er&mdash;jury,
        I mean the&mdash;er&mdash;guilty party, has been produced by the
        attitude of the&mdash;er&mdash;victim and martyr. You, madam, as the&mdash;er&mdash;injured
        wife (placing her), shall stand here, firm yet expectant, protecting
        your child, yet looking hopefully for assistance toward its natural
        protector. You, Miss Mary, shall stand here (placing her), as Moral
        Retribution, leaning toward and slightly appealing to me, the image of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Inflexible
        Justice! (Inflates his chest, puts his hand in his bosom, and strikes an
        attitude.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Door of young Morton's room opens, and discloses MR. OAKHURST gazing at
        the group. He starts slightly on observing the DUCHESS, but instantly
        recovers himself, and faces the company coldly. The DUCHESS starts on
        observing OAKHURST, and struggles in confusion towards the door,
        dragging with her the child and MISS MARY, who endeavors to re-assure
        her. COL. STARBOTTLE looks in astonishment from one to the other, and
        advances to front.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (aside). The&mdash;er&mdash;tableau, although striking
        in moral force, is apparently&mdash;er&mdash;deficient in moral stamina.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (angrily to the DUCHESS). I'm ashamed of you! (To OAKHURST,
        advancing.) I don't ask pardon for my intrusion. If you are Alexander
        Morton, you are my kinsman, and you will know that I cannot introduce
        myself better than as the protector of an injured woman. Come here! (To
        the DUCHESS, dragging her towards OAKHURST. To OAKHURST.) Look upon this
        woman: she claims to be&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (stepping between MISS MARY and the DUCHESS). A moment, Miss
        Mary, a single moment! Permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;explain. The whole
        thing, the&mdash;er&mdash;situation reminds me, demn me, of most amusing
        incident at Sacramento in '52. Large party at Hank Suedecois: know Hank?
        Confirmed old bach of sixty. Dinner for forty. Everything in style,
        first families, Ged,&mdash;Judge Beeswinger, Mat Boompointer, and Maje
        Blodgett of Ahlabam: know old Maje Blodgett? Well, Maje was there. Ged,
        sir, delay,&mdash;everybody waiting. I went to Hank. "Hank," I says,
        "what's matter? why delay?"&mdash;"Star," he says,&mdash;always called
        me Star,&mdash;"Star,&mdash;it's cook!"&mdash;"Demn cook," I says:
        "discharge cook,&mdash;only a black mulatto anyway!"&mdash;"Can't,
        Star," he says: "impossible!"&mdash;"Can't?" says I.&mdash;"No," says
        he. "Listen, Star," he says, "family secret! Honor! Can't discharge
        cook, because cook&mdash;demn it&mdash;'s MY wife!" Fact, sir, fact&mdash;showed
        marriage certificate&mdash;married privately seven years! Fact, sir&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (to MISS MARY). Some other time, miss, let us go now.
        There's a mistake, miss, I can't explain. Some other time, miss! See,
        miss, how cold and stern he looks! another time, miss! (Struggling.) For
        God's sake, miss, let me go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. No! This mystery must be cleared up now, before I enter HIS
        house,&mdash;before I accept the charge of this&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (interrupting, and crossing before MISS MARY). A moment&mdash;a
        single moment, miss. (To OAKHURST.) Mr. Morton, you will pardon the
        exuberance, and perhaps, under the circumstances, somewhat natural
        impulsiveness, of the&mdash;er&mdash;sex, for which I am perhaps
        responsible; I may say&mdash;er&mdash;personally, sir,&mdash;personally
        responsible&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (coldly). Go on, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. The lady on my right is&mdash;er&mdash;the niece of your
        father,&mdash;your cousin. The lady on my left, engaged in soothing the&mdash;er&mdash;bashful
        timidity of infancy, is&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;claims to
        be, the mother of the child of Alexander Morton.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (calmly). She is right.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (rushing forward). Then you are&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (gently restraining her). You have another question to ask: you
        hesitate: let me ask it. (Crossing to the DUCHESS.) You have heard my
        answer. Madam, are you the legal wife of Alexander Morton?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (sinking upon her knees, and dropping her face in her
        hands). No!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Enough: I will take the child. Pardon me, Miss Morris, but you
        have heard enough to know that your mission is accomplished, but what
        else passes between this woman and myself becomes no stranger to hear.
        (Motions toward room L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). It is HIS son. I am satisfied (going). Come, colonel.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exeunt into room L., STARBOTTLE and MISS MARY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (crossing to OAKHURST, and falling at his feet). Forgive me,
        Jack, forgive me! It was no fault of mine. I did not know that you were
        here. I did not know that you had taken his name!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hush&mdash;on your life!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Hear me, Jack! I was anxious only for a home for my child.
        I came to HER&mdash;the schoolmistress of Red Gulch&mdash;for aid. I
        told her the name of my boy's father. She&mdash;she brought me here. Oh,
        forgive me, Jack! I have offended you!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. How can I believe you? You have deceived HIM. You have
        deceived me. Listen! When I said, a moment ago, you were not the wife of
        Alexander Morton, it was because I knew that your first husband&mdash;the
        Australian convict Pritchard&mdash;was still living; that you had
        deceived Sandy Morton as you had deceived me. That was why I left you.
        Tell me, have you deceived me also about him, as you did about the
        other? Is HE living, and with you; or dead, as you declared.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (aside). He will kill me if I tell him. (Aloud.) No, no. He
        is gone&mdash;is dead these three years.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. You swear!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess (hesitates, gasps, and looks around for her child; then
        seizing it, and drawing it toward her). I&mdash;swear.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Enough. Seek not to know why I am here, and under his name.
        Enough for you that it has saved your child's future, and secured him
        his heritage past all revocation. Yet remember! a word from you within
        the next few days destroys it all. After that, I care not what you say.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        The Duchess. Jack! One word, Jack, before I go. I never thought to bring
        my shame to you!&mdash;to HIM!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. It was no trick, then, no contrivance, that brought her here.
        No: it was fate. And at least I shall save his child.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Re-enter STARBOTTLE, MISS MARY, and DUCHESS.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (impressively). Permit me, Mr. Alexander Morton, as the
        friend of my&mdash;er&mdash;principal to declare that we have received&mdash;honorable&mdash;honorable&mdash;satisfaction.
        Allow me, sir, to grasp the hand, the&mdash;er&mdash;cherished hand of a
        gentleman who, demn me! has fulfilled all his duties to&mdash;er&mdash;society
        and gentlemen. And allow me to add, sir, should any invidious criticism
        of the present&mdash;er&mdash;settlement be uttered in my presence, I
        shall hold that critic responsible, sir&mdash;er&mdash;personally
        responsible!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (sweeping truculently and aggressively up to JOHN OAKHURST).
        And permit ME to add, sir, that, if you can see your way clearly out of
        this wretched muddle, it's more than I can. This arrangement may be
        according to the Californian code of morality, but it doesn't accord
        with my Eastern ideas of right and wrong. If this foolish, wretched
        creature chooses to abandon all claim upon you, chooses to run away from
        you,&mdash;why, I suppose, as a GENTLEMAN, according to your laws of
        honor, you are absolved. Good-night, Mr. Alexander Morton. (Goes to door
        C., and exit, pushing out STARBOTTLE, the DUCHESS, and child. MR.
        OAKHURST sinks into chair at desk, burying his face in his hands.
        Re-enter slowly and embarrassedly, MISS MARY: looks toward OAKHURST, and
        comes slowly down stage.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). I was too hard on him. I was not so hard on Sandy
        when I thought that he&mdash;he&mdash;was the father of her child. And
        he's my own flesh and blood, too; and&mdash;he's crying. (Aloud.) Mr.
        Morton.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (slowly lifting his head). Yes; Miss Mary.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. I spoke hastily just then. I&mdash;I&mdash;thought&mdash;you
        see&mdash;I&mdash;(angrily and passionately) I mean this. I'm a
        stranger. I don't understand your Californian ways, and I don't want to.
        But I believe you've done what you thought was right, according to a
        MAN'S idea of right; and&mdash;there's my hand. Take it, take it; for
        it's a novelty, Mr. Morton: it's the hand of an honest girl!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (hesitates, then rises, sinks on one knee, and raises MISS
        MARY'S fingers to his lips). God bless you, miss! God bless you!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (retreating to centre door). Good-night, good-night (slowly),&mdash;cousin&mdash;Alexander.
        [Exit. Dark stage.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (rising swiftly). No, no: it is false! Ah! She's gone. Another
        moment, and I would have told her all. Pshaw! courage, man! It is only
        six days more, and you are free, and this year's shame and agony forever
        ended.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter JACKSON.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. As you ordered, sir, the night watchman has been relieved, and
        has just gone.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Very good, sir; and you?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jackson. I relieved the porter, sir; and I shall bunk on two chairs in
        the counting-room. You'll find me handy if you want me, sir. Good-night,
        sir. [Exit C.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. I fear these rascals will not dare to make their second
        attempt to-night. A quiet scrimmage with them, enough to keep me awake
        or from thinking, would be a good fortune. No, no! no such luck for you
        to-night, John Oakhurst! You are playing a losing game.... Yet the
        robbery was a bold one. At eleven o'clock, while the bank was yet
        lighted, and Mr. Jackson and another clerk were at work here, three
        well-dressed men pick the lock of the counting-house door, enter, and
        turn the key on the clerks in this parlor, and carry away a box of
        doubloons not yet placed in the vaults by the porter; and all this done
        so cautiously that the clerks within knew nothing of it until notified
        of the open street door by the private watchman, and so boldly that the
        watchman, seeing them here, believed them clerks of the bank, and let
        them go unmolested. No: this was the coincidence of good luck, not of
        bold premeditation. There will be no second attempt. (Yawns.) If they
        don't come soon I shall fall asleep. Four nights without rest will tell
        on a man, unless he has some excitement to back him. (Nods.) Hallo! What
        was that? Oh! Jackson in the counting-room getting to bed. I'll look at
        that front door myself. (Takes revolver from desk and goes to door C.,
        tries lock, comes down stage with revolver, examines it, and lays it
        down.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (slowly and quietly.) The door is locked on the outside: that
        may have been an accident. The caps are taken from my pistol: THAT was
        not! Well, here is the vault, and here is John Oakhurst: to reach the
        one, they must pass the other.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (Takes off his coat, seizes poker from grate, and approaches safe.) Ha!
        some one is moving in the old man's room. (Approaches door of room R. as&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter noiselessly and cautiously from room L., PRITCHARD, SILKY, and
        SOAPY. PRITCHARD and his confederates approach OAKHURST from behind,
        carrying lariat, or slip-noose.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (listening at door R.) Good. At least I know from what quarter
        to expect the attack. Ah!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        PRITCHARD throws slip-noose over OAKHURST from behind; OAKHURST puts his
        hand in his breast as the slip-noose is drawn across his bosom,
        pinioning one arm over his breast, and the other at his side. SILKY and
        SOAPY, directed by PRITCHARD, drag OAKHURST to chair facing front, and
        pinion his legs. PRITCHARD, C., regarding him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (very coolly). You have left me my voice, I suppose, because it
        is useless.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. That's so, pard. 'Twon't be no help to ye.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Then you have killed Jackson.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. Lord love ye, no! That ain't like us, pard! Jackson's tendin'
        door for us, and kinder lookin' out gin'rally for the boys. Thar's
        nothin' mean about Jackson.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Soapy. No! Jackson's a squar man. Eh, Silky?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Silky. Ez white a man ez they is, pard!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). The traitor! (Aloud.) Well!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. Well, you want ter know our business. Call upon a business
        man in business hours. Our little game is this, Mr. Jack Morton
        Alexander Oakhurst. When we was here the other night, we was wantin' a
        key to that theer lock (pointing to vault), and we sorter dropped in
        passin' to get it.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. And suppose I refuse to give it up?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. We were kalkilatin' on yer bein' even that impolite: wasn't
        we, boys?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Silky and Soapy. We was that.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. And so we got Mr. Jackson to take an impression of it in wax.
        Oh, he's a squar man&mdash;is Mr. Jackson!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Silky. Jackson is a white man, Soapy!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Soapy. They don't make no better men nor Jackson, Silky.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. And we've got a duplicate key here. But we don't want any
        differences, pard: we only want a squar game. It seemed to us&mdash;some
        of your old pards as knew ye, Jack&mdash;that ye had a rather soft thing
        here, reformin'; and we thought ye was kinder throwin' off on the boys,
        not givin' 'em any hand in the game. But thar ain't anythin' mean about
        us. Eh, boys?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Soapy. We is allers ready to chip in ekal in the game. Eh, Silky?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Silky. That's me, Soapy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. Ye see, the boys is free and open-handed, Jack. And so the
        proposition we wanter make to ye, Jack, is this. It's reg'lar on the
        squar. We reckon, takin' Mr. Jackson's word,&mdash;and thar ain't no
        man's word ez is better nor Jackson's,&mdash;that there's nigh on to two
        millions in that vault, not to speak of a little speshil deposit o'
        York's, ez we learn from that accommodatin' friend, Mr. Jackson. We
        propose to share it with ye, on ekil terms&mdash;us five&mdash;countin'
        Jackson, a square man. In course, we takes the risk o' packin' it away
        to-night comfortable. Ez your friends, Jack, we allow this yer little
        arrangement to be a deuced sight easier for you than playin' Sandy
        Morton on a riglar salary, with the chance o' the real Sandy poppin' in
        upon ye any night.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakkurst. It's a lie. Sandy is dead.
      </p>

        Pritchard. In course, in course; that is your little game! But we
        kalkilated, Jack, even on that, on yer bein' rambunktious and contrary;
        and so we went ter Red Gulch, and found Sandy. Ye know I take a kind o'
        interest in Sandy: he's the second husband of my wife, the woman you run
        away with, pard. But thar's nothin' mean about me! eh, boys?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Silky. No! he's the forgivingest kind of a man, is Pritchard.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Soapy. That's so, Silky.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. And, thinkin' ye might be dubious, we filled Sandy about full
        o' rye whiskey, and brought him along; and one of our pards is
        preambulatin' the streets with him, ready to bring him on call.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. It's a lie, Pritchard,&mdash;a cowardly lie!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. Is it? Hush!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (without, singing),&mdash;

     Oh, yer's yer Sandy Morton,

        Pritchard. We don't propose to run him in yer, cept we're took, or yer
        unaccommodatin' to the boys.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. And if I refuse?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard. Why, we'll take what we can get; and we'll leave Sandy Morton
        with you yer, to sorter alleviate the old man's feelin's over the loss
        of his money. There's nothin' mean about us; no! eh, boys? (Going toward
        safe.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hear me a moment, Henry Pritchard. (PRITCHARD stops abreast of
        OAKHURST.) Four years ago you were assaulted in the Arcade Saloon in
        Sacramento. You would have been killed, but your assailant suddenly fell
        dead by a pistol-shot fired from some unknown hand. I stood twenty feet
        from you with folded arms; but that shot was fired by me,&mdash;me,
        Henry Pritchard,&mdash;through my clothes, from a derringer hidden in my
        waistcoat! Understand me, I do not ask your gratitude now. But that
        pistol is in my right hand, and now covers you. Make a single motion,&mdash;of
        a muscle,&mdash;and it is your last.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Pritchard (motionless, but excitedly). You dare not fire! No, dare not!
        A shot here will bring my pal and Sandy Morton to confront you. You will
        have killed me to save exposure, have added murder to imposture! You
        have no witness to this attempt!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (opening door of room L., at the same moment that two policemen
        appear at door C., and two at room R). You are wrong: he has five
        (crossing to SILKY and SOAPY, and laying his hands on their shoulders);
        and, if I mistake not, he has two more in these gentlemen, whom I know,
        and who will be quite as willing to furnish the necessary State's
        evidence of the robbery, as of the fact that they never knew any other
        Alexander Morton than the gentleman who sits in that chair.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Soapy. That's so, Silky.

        Silky. That's so, Soapy.

        Capper (to policemen). Take them away.

        OAKHURST.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Then I have to thank you, Mr. C.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Yes! "A man of ridiculous theories, but well-meaning, brave, and
        honest." No, sir; don't apologize: you were right, Mr. Oakhurst. It is I
        who owe you an apology. I came here, believing YOU were the robber,
        having no faith in you or your reformation, expecting,&mdash;yes, sir,&mdash;hoping,
        to detect you in the act. Hear me! From the hour you first entered the
        bank, I have shadowed your every movement, I have been the silent
        witness of all that has passed in this room. You have played a desperate
        game, Mr. Oakhurst; but I'll see you through it. If you are true to your
        resolve, for the next six days, I will hold these wretches silent. I
        will protect your imposture with the strong arm of the law. I don't like
        YOUR theories, sir; but I believe you to be well-meaning, and I know you
        to be brave and honest.
      </p>

        Oakhurst (grasping his hand). I shall not forget this. But Sandy&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. I will put my men on his track, and have him brought quietly
        here. I can give you no aid beyond that. As an honorable man, I need not
        tell you your duty. Settle it with him as best you can.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. You are right; I WILL see him. (Aside.) Unless he has changed,
        he will listen to me, he will obey me.

        Morton. The private door open, the room dark, and Capper gone. I don't
        like this. The more I think of the mystery of that man's manner this
        morning, the more it seems to hide some terrible secret I must fathom!
        There are matches here. (Strikes a light, as CAPPER draws OAKHURST,
        struggling, back into shadow.) What's this? (Picking up key.) The key of
        the vault. A chair overturned. (Touches bell.) No answer! Jackson gone!
        My God! A terrible suspicion haunts me! No. Hush! (Retreats to private
        room R., as door of L. opens and&mdash;)

        Sandy (drunkenly). Shoo! Shoo! boys, whar are ye, boys, eh? Pritchard,
        Silky, Soapy! Whar are ye, boys?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (aside). A crime has been committed, and here is one of the gang.
        God has delivered him in my hands. (Draws revolver, and fires, as
        OAKHURST breaks from CAPPER, and strikes up MORTON'S pistol. CAPPER at
        same moment seizes SANDY, and drags him in room L. MORTON and OAKHURST
        struggle to centre.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (relaxing hold of OAKHURST). Alexander! Good God! Why are you
        here? Why have you stepped between me and retribution? You hesitate. God
        in heaven! Speak, Alexander, my son, speak for God's sake! Tell me&mdash;tell
        me that this detective's suspicions are not true. Tell me that you are
        not&mdash;not&mdash;no, I cannot say it. Speak, Alexander Morton, I
        command you! Who is this man you have saved? Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;your
        accomplice?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (sinking at his feet). Don't ask me! You know not what you ask!
        I implore you&mdash;

      <p><br />
        Capper (appearing quietly from room L., and locking the door behind
        him). Your son has acted under MY orders. The man he has saved, as he
        has saved you, was a decoy,&mdash;one of my policemen.

      <p><br />
        SCENE 1.&mdash;MR. MORTON'S villa, Russian Hill, Night. OAKHURST'S
        bedroom. Sofa in alcove C., door in flat left of C. SANDY MORTON
        discovered, unconscious, lying on sofa; OAKHURST standing at his head,
        two policemen at his feet. Candles on table L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. That will do. You are sure he was unconscious as you brought
        him in?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        First Policeman. Sure, sir? He hasn't known anything since we picked him
        up on the sidewalk outside the bank.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Good! You have fulfilled your orders well, and your chief
        shall know it. Go now. Be as cautious in going out as you were on
        entering. Here is the private staircase. (Opens door L.) [Exit
        policeman.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (listening). Gone! and without disturbing any one. So far, luck
        has befriended me. He will sleep to-night beneath his father's roof. His
        father! umph! would the old man recognize him here? Would he take to his
        heart this drunken outcast, picked from the gutters of the street, and
        brought here by the strong arm of the law? Hush! (A knock without.) Ah,
        it is the colonel: he is prompt to the hour. (Opens door cautiously, and
        admits COL. STARBOTTLE.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (looking around, and overlooking SANDY). I presume the other&mdash;er&mdash;principal
        is not yet on the ground?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (motioning to sofa). He IS!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (starting as he looks towards sofa). Ged, you don't mean to
        say it's all OVER, without witnesses, without my&mdash;er&mdash;presence?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Pardon me, Col. Starbottle; but, if you look again, you will
        perceive that the gentleman is only drunk.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Eh? Ged! not uncommon, sir, not uncommon! I remember
        singular incident at&mdash;er&mdash;Louisville in '47. Old Judge Tollim&mdash;know
        old Judge Tolly?&mdash;Ged! he came to ground drunk, sir; couldn't
        stand! Demn me, sir, had to put him into position with kitchen poker
        down his back, and two sections of lightning-rod in his&mdash;er&mdash;trousers,
        demn me! Firm, sir, firm, you understand, here (striking his breast),
        but&mdash;here (striking his legs)&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;wobbly! No,
        sir! Intoxication of principal not a bar, sir, to personal satisfaction!
        (Goes towards sofa with eyeglass.) Good Ged! why, it's Diego! (Returning
        stifly to OAKHURST.) Excuse me, sir, but this is a case in which I
        cannot act. Cannot, sir,&mdash;impossible! absurd! pre&mdash;post&mdash;or&mdash;ous!
        I recogmze in the&mdash;er&mdash;inebriated menial on yonder sofa a
        person, sir, who, having already declined my personal challenge, is&mdash;er&mdash;excluded
        from the consideration of gentlemen. The person who lies there, sir, is
        Diego,&mdash;a menial of Don Jose Castro,&mdash;-alias "Sandy," the
        vagabond of Red Gulch.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. You have omitted one title, his true one. He is Alexander
        Morton, the son of the master of this house.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (starting in bewilderment). Alexander Morton! (Aside.) Ged!
        my first suspicions were correct. Star, you have lost the opportunity of
        making your fortune as a scoundrel; but you have at a pecuniary
        sacrifice, preserved your honor.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Yes. Hear me, Col. Starbottle. I have summoned you here
        to-night, as I have already intimated, on an affair of honor. I have
        sought you as my father's legal counsel, as a disinterested witness, as
        a gentleman of honor. The man who lies before you was once my friend and
        partner. I have wronged him doubly. As his partner, I ran away with the
        woman he believed, and still believes, to be his wife; as his friend, I
        have for a twelvemonth kept him from the enjoyment of his home, his
        patrimony, by a shameful deception. I have summoned you to-night to
        witness my confession; as a lawyer, to arrange those details necessary
        to restore to him his property; as a man of honor, to receive from me
        whatever retribution he demands. You will be a witness to our interview.
        Whatever befalls me here, you will explain to Mr. Morton&mdash;to Jovita&mdash;that
        I accepted it as a man, and did not avoid, here or elsewhere, the
        penalty of my crime. (Folding his arms.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Slarbottle. Umph! The case is, as you say, a delicate one, but not&mdash;not&mdash;peculiar.
        No, sir! Ged, sir, I remember Tom Marshall&mdash;know Tom Marshall of
        Kentucky?&mdash;said to me, "Star!"&mdash;always calls me Star,&mdash;"how
        in blank, sir, can you remember the REAL names of your clients?"&mdash;"Why,"
        says I, "Tom," always called him Tom,&mdash;"yesterday I was called to
        make will&mdash;most distinguished family of Virginia&mdash;as lawyer
        and gentleman, you understand: can't mention name. Waited for signature&mdash;most
        distinguished name: Ged, sir, man signed Bloggins,&mdash;Peter Bloggins.
        Fact, demme! 'Mistake,' I said,&mdash;'excitement; exaltation of fever.
        Non compos. Compose yourself, Bob.'&mdash;'Star,' he said,&mdash;always
        called me Star,&mdash;'for forty-seven years I have been an impostor!'&mdash;his
        very words, sir. 'I am not'&mdash;you understand: 'I AM Peter
        Bloggins!'"
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. But, my dear colonel, I&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (loftily). Say no more, sir! I accept the&mdash;er position.
        Let us see! The gentleman will, on recognition, probably make a personal
        attack. You are armed. Ah, no? Umph! On reflection I would not permit
        him to strike a single blow: I would anticipate it. It will provoke the
        challenge from him, leaving YOU, sir, the&mdash;er&mdash;choice of
        weapons.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hush! he is moving! Take your stand here, in this alcove.
        Remember, as a gentleman, and a man of honor, Col. Starbottle, I trust
        you not to interfere between the injured man and&mdash;justice! (Pushes
        COL. STARBOTTLE into alcove behind couch, and approaches SANDY.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (waking slowly&mdash;and incoherently). Hush, Silky! hush! Eh? Oh,
        hush yourself! (Sings.)

        devil am I?

        Sandy (recoiling in astonishment). His voice, John Oakhurst! What&mdash;ah!
        (Rises, and rushes towards OAKHURST with uplifted hand.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (gesticulating in whisper). A blow! a single blow would be
        sufficient.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (looking at OAKHURST, who regards him calmly). I&mdash;eh! I&mdash;eh!
        Ha, ha! I'm glad to see&mdash;old pard! I'm glad to see ye! (COL.
        STARBOTTLE lifts his hand in amazement.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (declining his hand). Do you understand me, Sandy Morton?
        Listen. I am John Oakhurst,&mdash;the man who has deceived your father,
        who has deceived you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (without heeding his words, but regarding him affectionately). To
        think of it&mdash;Jack Oakhurst! It's like him, like Jack. He was allers
        onsartain, the darned little cuss! Jack! Look at him, will ye, boys?
        look at him! Growed too, and dressed to kill, and sittin' in this yer
        house as natril as a jaybird! (Looking around.) Nasty, ain't it, Jack?
        and this yer's your house&mdash;the old man's house&mdash;eh? Why, this
        is&mdash;this is where she came. Jack, Jack! (Eagerly.) Tell me, pard,
        where is she?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside, rubbing his hands). We shall have it now!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. She has gone,&mdash;gone! But hear me. She had deceived you as
        she has me. She has gone,&mdash;gone with her first husband, Henry
        Pritchard.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (stupefied). Gone! Her first husband! Pritchard!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Ay, your wife!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Oh, damn my wife! I'm talking of Mary,&mdash;Miss Mary,&mdash;the
        little schoolma'am, Jack; the little rose of Poker Flat. Oh! I see&mdash;ye
        didn't know her, Jack,&mdash;the pertiest, sweetest little&mdash;
      </p>

        Oakhurst (turning away coldly). Ay, ay! She is here!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (looking after him affectionately). Look at him, boys! Allers the
        same,&mdash;high-toned, cold, even to his pardner! That's him,&mdash;Jack
        Oakhurst! But Jack, Jack, you're goin' to shake hands, ain't ye?
        (Extends his hand, after a pause. OAKHURST takes it gloomily.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle (who has been regarding interview with visible scorn and
        disgust, advancing to OAKHURST). You will&mdash;er&mdash;pardon me if,
        under the&mdash;er&mdash;circumstances, I withdraw from this&mdash;er&mdash;disgraceful
        proceeding. The condonation, by that man, of two of the most tremendous
        offences to society and to the code, without apology or satisfaction,
        Ged, sir, is&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;of itself an insult to the
        spectator. I go, sir&mdash;

        laughing.

      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). He will change his mind in half an hour. But, in the
        mean time, time is precious. (Aloud.) Sandy, come!

        Sandy (rising with alacrity). Yes, Jack, I'm ready.

      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. We are going (slowly and solemnly)&mdash;we are going to see
        your father.

      <p><br />
        Sandy (dropping back with bashful embarrassment, and struggling to
        release his arm from OAKHURST). No, Jack! Not just yet, Jack; in a
        little while, ole boy! in about six months, or mebbe&mdash;a year, Jack!
        not now, not now! I ain't feelin' exactly well, Jack,&mdash;I ain't.

        since I met him. No, Jack; you don't play any ole man on to me to-night,

        Oakhurst. Impossible! Hush! (Listening.) It is HE passing through the
        corridor. (Goes to wing R., and listens.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (crowding hastily behind OAKHURST in alarm). But, I say, Jack! he
        won't come in here? He's goin' to bed, you know. Eh? It ain't right for
        a man o' his years&mdash;and he must be goin' on ninety, Jack&mdash;to
        be up like this. It ain't healthy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. You know him not. He seems to need no rest (sadly). Night
        after night, long after the servants are abed, and the house is still, I
        hear that step slowly pacing the corridor. It is the last sound as I
        close my eyes, the first challenge of the morning.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. The ol' scound&mdash;(checking himself)&mdash;I mean, Jack, the
        ol' man has suthin' on his mind. But, Jack (in great alarm), he don't
        waltz in upon ye, Jack? He don't p'int them feet in yer, Jack? Ye ain't
        got to put up with that, Jack, along o' yer other trials?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. He often seeks me here. Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;he is coming this
        way now.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (in ludicrous terror). Jack, pard, quick I hide me somewhere,
        Jack!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (opening door R.). In there, quick! Not a sound, as you value
        your future! [Exit SANDY hurriedly R.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 2.&mdash;The same. Enter door R., OLD MORTON, in dressing-gown,
        with candle.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Not abed yet, Alexander? Well, well, I don't blame you, my
        son it has been for you a trying, trying night. Yes, I see: like me, you
        are a little nervous and wakeful. (Slowly takes chair, and comfortably
        composes himself.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). He is in for a midnight gossip. How shall I dispose of
        Sandy?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Yes (meditatively),&mdash;yes, you have overworked lately.
        Never mind. In a day or two more you shall have a vacation, sir,&mdash;a
        vacation!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). He knows not how truly he speaks. (Aloud.) Yes, sir, I
        was still up. I have only just now dismissed the policemen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Ay. I heard voices, and saw a light in your window. I came
        to tell you, Alexander, Capper has explained all about&mdash;about the
        decoy! More; he has told me of your courage and your invaluable
        assistance. For a moment, sir,&mdash;I don't mind telling you now in
        confidence,&mdash;I doubted YOU&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (in feigned deprecation). Oh, sir!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Only for a moment. You will find, Alexander, that even that
        doubt shall have full apology when the year of your probation has
        expired. Besides, sir. I know all.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (starting). All!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Yes, the story about the Duchess and your child. You are
        surprised. Col. Starbottle told me all. I forgive you, Alexander, for
        the sake of your boy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. My boy, sir!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Yes, your boy. And let me tell you, sir, he's a fine young
        fellow. Looks like you,&mdash;looks as you did when YOU were a boy. He's
        a Morton too, every inch of him, there's no denying that. No, sir. You
        may have changed; but he&mdash;he&mdash;is the living image of my little
        Alexander. He took to me, too,&mdash;lifted his little arms&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;
        (Becomes affected, and leans his head in his hands.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (rising). You are not well, sir. Let me lead you to your room.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. No! it is nothing: a glass of water, Alexander!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). He is very pale. The agitation of the night has
        overcome him. (Goes to table R.) A little spirits will revive him.
        (Pours from decanter in glass, and returns to MORTON.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (after drinking). There was spirits in that water, Alexander.
        Five years ago, I vowed at your mother's grave to abandon the use of
        intoxicating liquors.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Believe me, sir, my mother will forgive you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Doubtless. It has revived me. I am getting to be an old man,
        Aleck. (Holds out his glass half-unconsciously, and OAKHURST replenishes
        it from decanter.) Yes, an old man, Aleck; but the boy,&mdash;ah, I live
        again in him. The little rascal! He asked me, Aleck, for a "chaw
        tobacker!" and wanted to know if I was the "ol' duffer." Ha, ha! He did.
        Ha, ha! Come, come, don't be despondent. I was like you once, damn it,&mdash;ahem&mdash;it's
        all for the best, my boy, all for the best. I'll take the young rascal
        (aside)&mdash;damn it, he's already taken me&mdash;(aloud) on equal
        terms. There, Aleck, what do you say?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Really, sir, this forbearance,&mdash;this kindness&mdash;(aside)
        I see a ray of light.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Nonsense! I'll take the boy, I tell you, and do well for
        him,&mdash;the little rascal!&mdash;as if he were the legal heir. But, I
        say, Aleck (laughing), ha, ha!&mdash;what about&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;what
        about Dona Jovita, eh? and what about Don Jose Castro, eh? How will the
        lady like a ready-made family, eh? (Poking OAKHURST in the ribs.) What
        will the Don say to the family succession? Ha, ha!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (proudly). Really, sir, I care but little.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (aside). Oh, ho! I'll sound him. (Aloud.) Look ye, Alexander,
        I have given my word to you and Don Jose Castro, and I'll keep it. But
        if you can do any better, eh&mdash;if&mdash;eh?&mdash;the schoolma'am's
        a mighty pretty girl and a bright one, eh, Aleck? And it's all in the
        family&mdash;eh? And she thinks well of you; and I will say, for a girl
        brought up as she's been, and knowin' your relations with the Duchess
        and the boy, to say a kind word for ye, Aleck, is a good sign,&mdash;you
        follow me, Aleck,&mdash;if you think&mdash;why, old Don Jose might
        whistle for a son-in-law, eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (interrupting indignantly). Sir! (Aside.) Stop! (Aloud.) Do you
        mean to say, sir, that if I should consent to this&mdash;suggestion&mdash;that,
        if the lady were willing, YOU would offer no impediment?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Impediment, my dear boy! you should have my blessing.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Pardon me a moment. You have in the last year, sir, taught me
        the importance of business formality in all the relations of life.
        Following that idea, the conditions of my engagement with Jovita Castro
        were drawn up with your hand. Are you willing to make this recantation
        as formal, this new contract as businesslike and valid?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (eagerly). I am.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Then sit here, and write at my dictation. (Pointing to table
        L. OLD MORTON takes seat at table.) "In view of the evident preferences
        of my son Alexander Morton, and of certain family interests, I hereby
        revoke my consent to his marriage with the Dona Jovita Castro, and
        accord him full permission to woo and win his cousin, Miss Mary Morris,
        promising him the same aid and assistance previously offered in his suit
        with Miss Castro."
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (signing). Alexander Morton, sen. There, Aleck! You have
        forgotten one legal formality. We have no witness. Ha, ha!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (significantly). I will be a sufficient witness.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Ha, ha! (Fills glass from decanter, after which OAKHURST
        quietly removes decanter beyond his reach.) Very good! Aleck, I've been
        thinking of a plan,&mdash;I've been thinking of retiring from the bank.
        I'm getting old, and my ways are not the popular ways of business here.
        I've been thinking of you, you dog,&mdash;of leaving the bank to you,&mdash;to
        you, sir, eh&mdash;the day&mdash;the day you marry the schoolma'am&mdash;eh.
        I'll stay home and take care of the boy&mdash;eh&mdash;hic! The little
        rascal!&mdash;lifted his arms to me&mdash;did, Aleck! by God!
        (Incoherently.) Eh!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hush! (Aside.) Sandy will overhear him, and appear.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (greatly affected by liquor.) Hush! eh!&mdash;of course&mdash;shoo!
        shoo! (The actor will here endeavor to reproduce in OLD MORTON'S drunken
        behavior, without exactly imitating him, the general characteristics of
        his son's intoxication.) Eh!&mdash;I say, Aleck, old boy! what will the
        Don say? eh? Ha, ha, ha! And Jovita, that firebrand, how will she&mdash;hic&mdash;like
        it, eh? (Laughs immoderately.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hush! We will be overheard! The servants, sir!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Damn the servants! Don't I&mdash;hic&mdash;pay them wages&mdash;eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Let me lead you to your own room. You are nervously excited. A
        little rest, sir, will do you good. (Taking his arm.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. No shir, no shir, 'm nerrer goin' to bed any more. Bed's bad
        habit!&mdash;hic&mdash;drunken habit. Lesh stay up all ni, Aleck! You
        and me! Lesh nev'r&mdash;go&mdash;bed any more! Whar's whiskey&mdash;eh?
        (Staggers to the table for decanter as OAKHURST seizes him, struggle up
        stage, and then OLD MORTON, in struggle, falls helplessly on sofa, in
        same attitude as SANDY was discovered.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SANDY cautiously from door L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (to OAKHURST). Jack! Eh, Jack&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Hush! Go! I will follow you in a moment. (Pushes him back to
        door L.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (catching sight of OLD MORTON). Hallo! What's up?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Nothing. He was overtaken with a sudden faintness. He will
        revive presently: go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (hesitating). I say, Jack, he wasn't taken sick along o' me, eh,
        Jack?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. No! No! But go (pushing him toward door).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Hold on: I'm going. But, Jack, I've got a kind of faintness yer,
        too. (Goes to side-table, and takes up decanter.) And thar's nothing
        reaches that faintness like whiskey. (Fills glass.) Old Morton
        (drunkenly and half-consciously from couch). Whiskey&mdash;who shed&mdash;whiskey&mdash;eh?
        Eh&mdash;O&mdash;gimme some, Aleck&mdash;Aleck, my son,&mdash;my son!&mdash;my
        old prodigal&mdash;Old Proddy, my boy&mdash;gimme&mdash;whiskey&mdash;(sings)&mdash;
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh, yer's yer good old whiskey,
           Drink it down!
</pre>
      <p><br />
        Eh? I com&mdash;mand you,&mdash;pass the whiskey!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SANDY, at first panic-stricken, and then remorsefully conscious, throws
        glass down, with gesture of fear and loathing. OAKHURST advances to his
        side hurriedly.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (in hurried whisper). Give him the whiskey, quick! It will keep
        him quiet. (Is about to take decanter when SANDY seizes it: struggle
        with OAKHURST.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (with feeling). No, no, Jack, no! (Suddenly with great strength
        and determination, breaks from him, and throws decanter from window.)
        No, NEVER!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (struggling drunkenly to his feet). Eh&mdash;who sh'd never?
        (OAKHURST shoves SANDY in room L., and follows him, closing door.) Eh,
        Aleck? (Groping.) Eh, where'sh light? All gone. (Lapses on sofa again,
        after an ineffectual struggle to get up, and then resumes his old
        attitude.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (Change scene quickly.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 3.&mdash;Ante-room in MR. MORTON'S villa. Front scene. Enter DON
        JOSE CASTRO and CONCHO, preceded by SERVANT, L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. This way, gentlemen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Carry this card to Alexander Morton, sen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. Beg pardon, sir, but there's only one name here, sir (looking
        at CONCHO).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (proudly). That is my servant, sir. [Exit SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). I don't half like this business. But my money locked
        up in his bank, and my daughter's hand bound to his son, demand it.
        (Aloud.) This is no child's play, Concho, you understand.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Ah! I am wise. Believe me, if I have not proofs which shall
        blanch the cheek of this old man, I am a fool, Don Jose!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Re-enter SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. Mr. Morton, sen., passed a bad night, and has left word not to
        be disturbed this morning. But Mr. Morton, jun., will attend you, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (aside). So the impostor will face it out. Well, let him come.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (to SERVANT) I wait his pleasure. [Exit SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. You hear, Concho? You shall face this man. I shall repeat to
        him all you have told me. If you fail to make good your charge, on your
        head rests the consequences.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. He will of course deny. He is a desperate man: he will perhaps
        attack me. Eh! Ah! (Drawing revolver.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Put up your foolish weapon. The sight of the father he has
        deceived will be more terrible to him than the pistol of the spy.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter COL. STARBOTTLE, C.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Mr. Alexander Morton, Jun., will be with you in a moment.
        (Takes attitude by door, puts his hand in his breast, and inflates
        himself.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (to DON JOSE, aside). It is the bullying lawyer. They will try to
        outface us, my patron; but we shall triumph. (Aloud.) He comes, eh!&mdash;Mr.
        Alexander Morton, gentlemen! I will show you a cheat, an impostor!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter, in correct, precise morning dress, SANDY MORTON. There is in his
        make-up and manner a suggestion of the father.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (recoiling, aside). Diego! The real son. (Aloud, furiously.) It
        is a trick to defeat justice,&mdash;eh!&mdash;a miserable trick! But it
        shall fail, it shall fail!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Permit me, a moment,&mdash;a single moment. (To
        Concho.) You have&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;characterized my introduction
        of this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman as a "cheat" and an "imposture." Are
        you prepared to deny that this is Alexander Morton?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (astonished, aside). These Americanos are of the Devil! (Aloud
        and sternly.) Answer him, Concho, I command you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (in half-insane rage). It is Alexander Morton; but it is a trick,&mdash;a
        cowardly trick! Where is the other impostor, this Mr. John Oakhurst?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (advancing with dignity and something of his father's cold
        manner). He will answer for himself, when called for. (To DON JOSE.) You
        have asked for me, sir: may I inquire your business?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Eh! It is a trick,&mdash;a trick!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (to CONCHO). Silence, sir! (To SANDY, with dignity.) I know not
        the meaning of this masquerade. I only know that you are NOT the
        gentleman hitherto known to me as the son of Alexander Morton. I am
        here, sir, to demand my rights as a man of property and a father. I have
        received this morning a check from the house of Morton &amp; Son, for
        the amount of my deposit with them. So far&mdash;in view of this
        complication&mdash;it is well. Who knows? Bueno! But the signature of
        Morton &amp; Son to the check is not in the handwriting I have known.
        Look at it, sir. (To SANDY, handing check.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (examining check). It is my handwriting, sir, and was signed this
        morning. Has it been refused?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Pardon me, sir. It has not been presented. With this doubt in
        my mind, I preferred to submit it first to you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. A moment, a single moment, sir. While as a&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman
        and a man of honor, I&mdash;er&mdash;appreciate your motives, permit me
        to say, sir, as a lawyer, that your visit is premature. On the testimony
        of your own witness, the identification of Mr. Alexander Morton, jun.,
        is&mdash;er&mdash;complete; he has admitted the signature as his own;
        you have not yet presented the check to the bank.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Pardon me, Col. Starbottle. It is not all. (To SANDY.) By a
        written agreement with Alexander Morton, sen., the hand of my daughter
        is promised to his son, who now stands before me, as my former servant,
        dismissed from my service for drunkenness.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. That agreement is revoked.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Revoked!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (handing paper). Cast your eyes over that paper. At least you will
        recognize THAT signature.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (reads). "In view of the evident preferences of my son,
        Alexander Morton, and of certain family interests, I hereby revoke my
        consent to his marriage with the Dona Jovita Castro, and accord him full
        permission to woo and win his cousin, Miss Mary Morris; promising him
        the same aid and assistance previously offered in his suit with Miss
        Castro.&mdash;ALEXANDER MORTON, SEN."
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Ah! Carramba! Do you not see the trick,&mdash;eh, the
        conspiracy? It was this man, as Diego, your daughter's groom, helped his
        friend Mr. Oakhurst to the heiress. Ah, you comprehend! It was an old
        trick! You shall see, you shall see! Ah! I am wise, I am wise!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (aside). Could I have been deceived? But no! This paper that
        releases HIM gives the impostor no claim.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (resuming his old easy manner, dropping his formality, and placing
        his hand on DON JOSE'S shoulder). Look yar, ole man: I didn't allow to
        ever see ye agin, and this yer ain't none o' MY seekin'. But, since yer
        here, I don't mind tellin' ye that but for me that gal of yours would
        have run away a year ago, and married an unknown lover. And I don't mind
        adding, that, hed I known that unknown lover was my friend John
        Oakhurst, I'd have helped her do it. (Going.) Good-morning, Don Jose.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Insolent! I shall expect an account for this from your&mdash;father,
        sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Adios, Don Jose. [Exit C.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. It is a trick&mdash;I told you. Ah, I am wise. (Going to DON
        JOSE.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose (throwing him off). Fool! [Exit DON JOSE.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (infuriated). Eh! Fool yourself&mdash;dotard! No matter: I will
        expose all&mdash;ah! I will see Jovita;&mdash;I will revenge myself on
        this impostor! (Is about to follow, when COL. STARBOTTLE leaves his
        position by the door, and touches CONCHO on the shoulder.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Excuse me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. You have forgotten something.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Conhho. Something?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. An apology, sir. You were good enough to express&mdash;er&mdash;incredulity&mdash;when
        I presented Mr. Morton: you were kind enough to characterize the conduct
        of my er&mdash;principal by&mdash;an epithet. You have alluded to me,
        sir,&mdash;ME&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (wrathfully). Bully! (Aside.) I have heard that this pomposo,
        this braggart, is a Yankee trick too; that he has the front of a lion,
        the liver of the chicken. (Aloud.) Yes, I have said, you hear I have
        said, I, Concho (striking his breast), have said you are a&mdash;bully!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (coolly). Then you are prepared to give me satisfaction, sir,&mdash;personal
        satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (raging). Yes, sir, now&mdash;you understand, now (taking out
        pistol), anywhere, here! Yes, here. Ah! you start,&mdash;yes, here and
        now! Face to face, you understand, without seconds,&mdash;face to face.
        So. (Presenting pistol.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (quietly). Permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;apologize.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Ah! It is too late!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (interrupting). Excuse me, but I feared you would not honor
        me so completely and satisfactorily. Ged, sir, I begin to respect you! I
        accede to all your propositions of time and position. The pistol you
        hold in your hand is a derringer, I presume, loaded. Ah&mdash;er&mdash;I
        am right. The one I now produce (showing pistol) is&mdash;er&mdash;as
        you will perceive the same size and pattern, and&mdash;er&mdash;unloaded.
        We will place them both, so, under the cloth of this table. You shall
        draw one pistol, I will take the other. I will put that clock at ten
        minutes to nine, when we will take our positions across this table; as
        you&mdash;er&mdash;happily express it, "face to face." As the clock
        strikes the hour, we will fire on the second stroke.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (aside). It is a trick, a Yankee trick! (Aloud.) I am ready. Now&mdash;at
        once!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (gravely). Permit me, sir, to thank you. Your conduct, sir,
        reminds me of singular incident&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (angrily interrupting). Come, come! It is no child's play. We
        have much of this talk, eh! It is action, eh, you comprehend,&mdash;action.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        (STARBOTTLE places pistols under the cloth, and sets clock. CONCHO draws
        pistol from cloth; STARBOTTLE takes remaining pistol. Both men assume
        position, presenting their weapons; STARBOTTLE pompously but seriously,
        CONCHO angrily and nervously.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (after a pause). One moment, a single moment&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Ah, a trick! Coward! you cannot destroy my aim.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. I overlook the&mdash;er&mdash;epithet. I wished only to ask,
        if you should be&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunate, if there was anything I
        could say to your&mdash;er&mdash;friends.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. You cannot make the fool of me, coward. No!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. My object was only precautionary. Owing to the position in
        which you&mdash;er&mdash;persist in holding your weapon, in a line with
        my right eye, I perceive that a ray of light enters the nipple, and&mdash;er&mdash;illuminates
        the barrel. I judge from this that you have been unfortunate enough to
        draw the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;unloaded pistol.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (tremulously lowering weapon). Eh! Ah! This is murder! (Drops
        pistol.) Murder!&mdash;eh&mdash;help (retreating), help!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exit hurriedly door C., as clock strikes. COL. STARBOTTLE lowers his
        pistol, and moves with great pomposity to the other side of the table,
        taking up pistol.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (examining pistol). Ah! (Lifts it, and discharges it.) It
        seems that I am mistaken. (Going.) The pistol WAS&mdash;er&mdash;loaded!
        [Exit.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 4.&mdash;Front scene. Room in villa. Enter MISS MARY and JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. I tell you, you are wrong, you are not only misunderstanding
        your lover, which is a woman's privilege, but you are abusing my cousin,
        which, as his relative, I won't put up with.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (passionately). But hear me, Miss Mary. It is a year since we
        were betrothed; and such a betrothal! Why, I was signed, sealed, and
        delivered to him, on conditions, as if I were a part of the rancho; and
        the very night, too, I had engaged to run away with him! And during that
        year I have seen the gentleman twice,&mdash;yes, twice!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. But he has written?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Mother of God! Yes,&mdash;letters delivered by my father, sent
        to HIS CARE, read by him first, of course; letters hoping that I was
        well, and obeying my father's commands; letters assuring me of his
        unaltered devotion; letters that, compared with the ones he used to hide
        in the confessional of the ruined mission church, were as ice to fire,
        were as that snow-flower you value so much, Mary, to this mariposa
        blossom I wear in my hair. And then to think that this man&mdash;this
        John Oakhurst, as I knew him; this man who used to ride twenty miles for
        a smile from me on the church porch; this Don Juan who leaped that
        garden wall (fifteen feet, Mary, if it is an inch), and made old Concho
        his stepping-stone; this man, who daily perilled death for my sake&mdash;is
        changed into this formal, methodical man of business&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;I
        tell you there's a WOMAN at the bottom of it! I know it sure!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). How can I tell her about the Duchess? I won't!
        (Aloud.) But listen, my dear Jovita. You know he is under probation for
        you, Jovita. All this is for you. His father is cold, methodical,
        unsympathetic. HE looks only to his bond with this son,&mdash;this son
        that he treats, even in matters of the heart, as a BUSINESS partner.
        Remember, on his complete reformation, and subjection to his father's
        will, depends your hand. Remember the agreement!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. The agreement; yes! It is the agreement, always the agreement!
        May the Devil fly away with the agreement! Look you, Miss Mary, I, Dona
        Jovita, didn't fall in love with an agreement: it was with a man! Why, I
        might have married a dozen agreements&mdash;yes, of a shorter limitation
        than this! (Crossing.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Yes. But what if your lover had failed to keep those promises
        by which he was to gain your hand? what if he were a man incapable of
        self-control? what if he were&mdash;a&mdash;a drunkard?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (musing). A drunkard! (Aside.) There was Diego, he was a
        drunkard; but he was faithless. (Aloud.) You mean a weak, faithless
        drunkard?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. No! (Sadly.) Faithless only to himself, but devoted&mdash;yes,
        devoted to YOU.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Miss Mary, I have found that one big vice in a man is apt to
        keep out a great many smaller ones.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Yes; but if he were a slave to liquor?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. My dear, I should try to change his mistress. Oh, give me a man
        that is capable of a devotion to anything, rather than a cold,
        calculating average of all the virtues!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). I, who aspire to be her teacher, am only her pupil.
        (Aloud.) But what if, in this very drunkenness, this recklessness, he
        had once loved and worshipped another woman? What if you discovered all
        this after&mdash;after&mdash;he had won your heart?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. I should adore him! Ah, Miss Mary! Love differs from all the
        other contagious diseases: the last time a man is exposed to it, he
        takes it most readily, and has it the worst! But you, YOU cannot
        sympathize with me. You have some lover, the ideal of the virtues; some
        man as correct, as well regulated, as calm as&mdash;yourself; some one
        who addresses you in the fixed morality and severe penmanship of the
        copy-books. He will never precipitate himself over a garden wall or
        through a window. Your Jacob will wait for you through seven years, and
        receive you from the hands of your cousin and guardian&mdash;as a reward
        of merit! No, you could not love a vagabond.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (very slowly and quietly). No?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. No! (Passionately.) No, it is impossible. Forgive me, Miss Mary:
        you are good; a better girl than I am. But think of me! A year ago my
        lover leaped a wall at midnight to fly with me: today, the day that
        gives me to him, he writes a few cold lines, saying that he has
        business, BUSINESS&mdash;you understand&mdash;business, and that he
        shall not see me until we meet in the presence of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;our
        fathers.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Yes; but you will see him at least, perhaps alone. Listen: it
        is no formal meeting, but one of festivity. My guardian has told me, in
        his quaint scriptural way, it is the killing of the fatted calf, over
        his long-lost prodigal. Have patience, little one. Ah! Jovita, we are of
        a different race, but we are of one sex; and as a woman I know how to
        accept another woman's abuse of her lover. Come, come! [Exeunt MISS MARY
        and JOVITA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 5.&mdash;The drawing-room of MR. MORTON'S villa. Large open arch
        in centre, leading to veranda, looking on distant view of San Francisco;
        richly furnished,&mdash;sofas, arm-chairs, and tete-a-tetes. Enter COL.
        STARBOTTLE, C., carrying bouquet, preceded by SERVANT, bowing.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Take my kyard to Miss Morris. [Exit SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Star! This is the momentous epoch of your life! It is a
        moment for which you&mdash;are&mdash;I may say alone responsible,&mdash;personally
        responsible! She will be naturally gratified by the&mdash;er&mdash;flowers.
        She will at once recognize this bouquet as a delicate souvenir of Red
        Gulch, and will appreciate your recollection. And the fact, the crushing
        fact, that you have overlooked the&mdash;er&mdash;ungentlemanly conduct
        of her OWN cousin Sandy, the real Alexander Morton, that you have&mdash;er&mdash;assisted
        to restore the ex-vaquero to his rights, will&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;at
        once open the door to&mdash;er&mdash;mutual confidence and&mdash;er&mdash;a
        continuance of that&mdash;er&mdash;prepossession I have already noticed.
        Ahem! here she is.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter MISS MARY in full dress.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. You are early, Col. Starbottle. This promptitude does honor
        to our poor occasion.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle. Ged, Miss Mary, promptness with a lady and an adversary
        is the first duty of&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman. I wished that&mdash;er&mdash;the
        morning dew might still be&mdash;er&mdash;fresh in these flowers. I
        gathered them myself (presenting bouquet) at&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;flower-stand
        in the&mdash;er&mdash;California market.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). Flowers! I needed no such reminder of poor Sandy.
        (Aloud.) I thank you, colonel.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbattle. Ged, ma'am, I am repaid doubly. Your conduct, Miss Mary,
        reminds me of little incident that occurred at Richmond, in '58. Dinner
        party&mdash;came early&mdash;but obliged to go&mdash;as now&mdash;on
        important business, before dessert&mdash;before dessert. Lady sat next
        to me&mdash;beautiful woman&mdash;excuse me if I don't mention names&mdash;said
        to me, "Star,"&mdash;always called me Star,&mdash;"Star, you remind me
        of the month of May."&mdash;"Ged, madam,"&mdash;I said, "delighted,
        proud; but why?"&mdash;"Because," she said, "you come in with the&mdash;er&mdash;oysters."&mdash;No!
        Ged, pardon me&mdash;ridiculous mistake! I mean&mdash;er&mdash;"you come
        in with the&mdash;er&mdash;flowers, and go before the&mdash;er&mdash;fruits."
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. Ah, colonel! I appreciate her disappointment. Let us hope,
        however, that some day you may find that happy woman who will be able to
        keep you through the whole dinner and the whole season, until December
        and the ices!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Ged! excellent! Capital! (seriously.) Miss Mary! (Suddenly
        inflating his chest, striking attitude, and gazing on MISS MARY with
        languishing eyes.) There is&mdash;er such a woman!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). What can he mean?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (taking seat beside her). Allow me, Miss Mary, a few moments
        of confidential&mdash;er&mdash;confidential disclosure. To-day is, as
        you are aware&mdash;the day on which, according to&mdash;er&mdash;agreement
        between parties, my friend and client, Mr. Morton, sen.,&mdash;formally
        accepts his prodigal son. It is my&mdash;er&mdash;duty to state that&mdash;er&mdash;the
        gentleman who has for the past year occupied that position has behaved
        with great discretion, and&mdash;er&mdash;fulfilled his part of the&mdash;er&mdash;agreement.
        But it would&mdash;er&mdash;appear that there has been a&mdash;er&mdash;slight
        delusion regarding the identity of that prodigal,&mdash;a delusion
        shared by all the parties except, perhaps, myself. I have to prepare you
        for a shock. The gentleman whom you have recently known as Alexander
        Morton, jun., is not the prodigal son; is not your&mdash;er&mdash;cousin;
        is, in fact, no relation to you. Prepare yourself, Miss Mary, for a
        little disappointment,&mdash;for&mdash; er&mdash;degradation. The
        genuine son has been&mdash;er&mdash;discovered in the person of&mdash;er&mdash;low
        menial&mdash;or&mdash;vagabond,&mdash;"Sandy," the&mdash;er&mdash;outcast
        of Red Gulch!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (rising in astonishment). Sandy! Then he was right. (Aside.)
        The child is his! and that woman&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Compose yourself, Miss Mary. I know the&mdash;er&mdash;effect
        of&mdash;er&mdash;revelation like this upon&mdash;er&mdash;proud and
        aristocratic nature. Ged! My own, I assure you, beats in&mdash;er&mdash;responsive
        indignation. You can never consent to remain beneath this roof, and&mdash;er&mdash;receive
        a&mdash;er&mdash;vagabond and&mdash;er&mdash;menial on equal terms. The&mdash;er&mdash;necessities
        of my&mdash;er&mdash;profession may&mdash;er&mdash;compel me; but you&mdash;er&mdash;never!
        Holding myself&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;responsible for having introduced
        you here, it is my&mdash;er&mdash;duty to provide you with&mdash;another
        home! It is my&mdash;er&mdash;duty to protect&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (aside). Sandy here, and beneath this roof! Why has he not
        sought me? Ah, I know too well: he dare not face me with his child!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (aside). She turns away! it is maiden coyness. (Aloud.) If,
        Miss Mary, the&mdash;er&mdash;devotion of a life-time; if the&mdash;er&mdash;chivalrous
        and respectful adoration of a man&mdash;er&mdash;whose record is&mdash;er&mdash;not
        unknown in the Court of Honor (dropping on one knee with excessive
        gallantry); if the&mdash;er&mdash;measure&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (oblivious of COL. STARBOTTLE). I WILL&mdash;I MUST see him!
        Ah! (looking L.) he is coming!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SANDY.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (rising with great readiness and tact). I have found it
        (presenting flower). It had fallen beneath the sofa.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (to MISS MARY, stopping short in embarrassment). I did not know
        you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;thought there was no one here.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (to STARBOTTLE). May I ask you to excuse me for a moment? I
        have a few words to say to&mdash;to my COUSIN!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        STARBOTTLE bows gallantly to MISS MARY, and stiffly to SANDY, and exit
        R. A long pause; MISS MARY remains seated pulling flowers, SANDY remains
        standing by wing, foolish and embarrassed. Business.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (impatiently). Well?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (slowly). I axes your pardon, miss; but you told THAT gentleman
        you had a few words&mdash;to say to me.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary (passionately, aside). Fool! (Aloud.) I had; but I am waiting
        to first answer your inquiries about your&mdash;your&mdash;child. I have
        fulfilled my trust, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. You have, Miss Mary, and I thank you.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. I might perhaps have expected that this revelation of our
        kinship would have come from other lips than a stranger's; but&mdash;no
        matter! I wish you joy, sir, of your heritage. (Going.) You have found a
        home, sir, at last, for yourself and&mdash;and&mdash;your child.
        Good-day, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Miss Mary!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. I must make ready to receive your father's guests. It is his
        orders: I am only his poor relation. Good-by, sir. [Exit L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (watching her). She is gone!&mdash;gone! No! She has dropped on
        the sofa in the ante-room, and is crying. Crying! I promised Jack I
        wouldn't speak until the time came. I'll go back. (Hesitating, and
        looking toward L.) Poor girl! How she must hate me! I might just say a
        word, one word to thank her for her kindness to Johnny,&mdash;only one
        word, and then go away. I&mdash;I&mdash;can keep from liquor. I swore I
        would to Jack, that night I saw the old man&mdash;drunk,&mdash;and I
        have. But&mdash;I can't keep&mdash;from&mdash;her! No&mdash;damn it!
        (Going toward L.) No!&mdash;I'll go! [Exit L.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter hurriedly and excitedly JOVITA, R., followed by MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Where is she? Where is HE?&mdash;the traitor!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela (entreatingly). Compose yourself, Dona Jovita, for the love of
        God! This is madness: believe me, there is some mistake. It is some
        trick of an enemy,&mdash;of that ingrate, that coyote, Concho, who hates
        the Don Alexandro.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. A trick! Call you this a trick? Look at this paper, put into my
        hands by my father a moment ago. Read it. Ah! listen. (Reads.) "In view
        of the EVIDENT PREFERENCES of my son, Alexander Morton, I hereby revoke
        my consent to his marriage with the Dona Jovita Castro, and accord him
        full permission to woo and win his cousin, Miss Mary Morris!" Call you
        this a trick, eh? No, it is their perfidy! This is why SHE was brought
        here on the eve of my betrothal. This accounts for his silence, his
        absence. Oh, I shall go mad!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Compose yourself, miss. If I am not deceived, there is one here
        who will aid us,&mdash;who will expose this deceit. Listen: an hour ago,
        as I passed through the hall, I saw Diego, our old Diego,&mdash;your
        friend and confidant, Diego.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. The drunkard&mdash;the faithless Diego!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Never, Miss Jovita; not drunken! For, as he passed before me,
        he was as straight, as upright, as fine as your lover. Come, miss, we
        will seek him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita. Never! He, too, is a traitor.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Believe me, no! Come, Miss Jovita. (Looking toward L.) See, he
        is there. Some one is with him.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (looking). You are right; and it is she&mdash;SHE, Miss Mary!
        What? he is kissing her hand! and she&mdash;SHE, the double traitress&mdash;drops
        her head upon his shoulder! Oh, this is infamy!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Manuela. Hush! Some one is coming. The guests are arriving. They must
        not see you thus. This way, Miss Jovita,&mdash;this way. After a little,
        a little, the mystery will be explained. (Taking JOVITA'S hand, and
        leading her R.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (going). And this was the correct schoolmistress, the preceptress
        and example of all the virtues! ha! (laughing hysterically) ha!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        [Exeunt JOVITA and MANUELA.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        SCENE 6.&mdash;The same. Enter SERVANT; opens folding doors C.,
        revealing veranda and view of distant city beyond. Stage, fog effect
        from without. Enter STARBOTTLE and OAKHURST, R., in full evening dress.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (walking towards veranda). A foggy evening for our
        anniversary.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. Yes. (Aside.) It was such a night as this I first stepped into
        Sandy's place, I first met the old man. Well, it will be soon over.
        (Aloud.) You have the papers and transfers all ready?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. In my&mdash;er&mdash;pocket. Mr. Morton, sen., should be
        here to receive his guests.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. He will be here presently: until then the duty devolves on me.
        He has secluded himself even from me! (Aside.) Perhaps it is in very
        shame for his recent weakness.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. Don Jose Castro, Miss Castro, and Miss Morris.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter DON JOSE with JOVITA and MISS MARY on either arm. All formally
        salute MR. OAKHURST, except MISS JOVITA, who turns coldly away, taking
        seat remotely on sofa. COL. STARBOTTLE gallantly approaches MISS MARY,
        and takes seat beside her.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (aside). They are here to see my punishment. There is no
        sympathy even in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. Mr. Concepcion Garcia and Mr. Capper.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (approaching OAKHURST, rubbing his hands). I wish you joy, Mr.
        Alexander Morton!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (excitedly, aside). Shall I throw him from the window! The dog!&mdash;even
        he!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (approaching MR. OAKHURST). You have done well. Be bold. I will
        see you through. As for THAT man (pointing to CONCHO), leave him to ME!
        (Lays his hand on Concho's shoulder, and leads him to sofa R. OAKHURST
        takes seat in chair L. as SANDY enters quietly from door L., and stands
        leaning upon his chair.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (rising). Ladies and gentlemen, we are waiting only for the
        presence of Mr. Alexander Morton, sen. I regret to say that for the last
        twenty-four hours&mdash;he has been&mdash;er&mdash;exceedingly
        preoccupied with the momentous cares of the&mdash;er&mdash;occasion. You
        who know the austere habits of my friend and&mdash;er&mdash;client will
        probably understand that he may be at this very moment engaged in
        prayerful and Christian meditation, invoking the Throne of Grace,
        previous to the solemn duties of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;tonight.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter SERVANT.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Servant. Mr. Alexander Morton, sen.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Enter OLD MORTON, drunk, in evening costume, cravat awry, coat
        half-buttoned up, and half-surly, half-idiotic manner. All rise in
        astonishment. SANDY starts forward. OAKHURST pulls him back.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Morton (thickly). Don't rish! Don't rish! We'll all sit down! How do you
        do, sir? I wish ye well, miss. (Goes around and laboriously shakes hands
        with everybody.) Now lesh all take a drink! lesh you take a drink, and
        you take a drink, and you take a drink!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to&mdash;er&mdash;explain:
        our friend is&mdash;er&mdash;evidently laboring under&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;accident
        of hospitality! In a moment he will be himself.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Hush up! Dry up&mdash;yourself&mdash;old turkey-cock! Eh!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (despairingly). He will not understand us! (To STARBOTTLE.) He
        will not know me! What is to be done?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Give me some whishkey. Lesh all take a drink! (Enter SERVANT
        with decanter and glasses.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (starting forward). Lesh all take a drink!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Stop!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (recovering himself slightly). Who says stop? Who dares
        countermand my orderish?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (coming forward). Who? I will tell you: eh! eh! Diego&mdash;dismissed
        from the rancho of Don Jose for drunkenness! Sandy&mdash;the vagabond of
        Red Gulch!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (passionately seizing OLD MORTON'S arm). Yes, Diego&mdash;Sandy&mdash;the
        outcast&mdash;but, God help me! no longer the drunkard. I forbid you to
        touch that glass!&mdash;I, your son, Alexander Morton! Yes, look at me,
        father: I, with drunkenness in my blood, planted by you, fostered by you&mdash;I
        whom you sought to save&mdash;I&mdash;I stand here to save you! Go! (To
        SERVANT.) Go! While he is thus, I&mdash;I, am master here!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (cowed and frightened). That voice! (Passing his hand over
        his forehead.) Am I dreaming Aleck, where are you? Alexander, speak, I
        command you: is this the truth?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (slowly). It is!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. One moment&mdash;a single moment: permit me to&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;explain.
        The gentleman who has just&mdash;er&mdash;dismissed the refreshment is,
        to the best of my legal knowledge, your son. The gentleman who for the
        past year has so admirably filled the functions of that office is&mdash;er&mdash;prepared
        to admit this. The proofs are&mdash;er&mdash;conclusive. It is with the&mdash;er&mdash;intention
        of offering them, and&mdash;er&mdash;returning your lawful heir, that we&mdash;er&mdash;are
        here to-night.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (rising to his feet). And renounce you both! Out of my house,
        out of my sight, out of my heart, forever! Go! liars, swindlers,
        confederates! Drunk&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (retiring slowly with SANDY). We are going, sir!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Go! open the doors there WIDE, wide enough for such a
        breadth of infamy! Do you hear me? I am master here!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Stands erect, as OAKHURST and SANDY, hand in hand, slowly retreat
        backward to centre,&mdash;then suddenly utters a cry, and falls heavily
        on sofa. Both pause: OAKHURST remains quiet and motionless; SANDY, after
        a moment's hesitation, rushes forward, and falls at his feet.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. Father, forgive me!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (putting his hand round SANDY'S neck, and motioning him to
        door). Go! both of you, both of you! (Resisting SANDY'S attempt to
        rise.) Did you hear me? Go!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. Permit me to&mdash;explain. Your conduct, Mr. Morton,
        reminds me of sing'lar incident in '47&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Silence!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. One word, Mr. Morton! Shamed and disgraced as I am, I leave
        this roof more gladly than I entered it. How I came here, you best know.
        How I yielded madly to the temptation, the promise of a better life; how
        I fell, through the hope of reformation,&mdash;no one should know better
        than you, sir, the reformer. I do not ask your pardon. You know that I
        did my duty to you as your presumed son. Your real son will bear
        witness, that, from the hour I knew of his existence, I did my duty
        equally to him. Col. Starbottle has all the legal transfers and papers
        necessary to make the restoration of your son&mdash;the integrity of
        your business name&mdash;complete. I take nothing out of this life that
        I did not bring in it,&mdash;except my self-respect! I go&mdash;as I
        came&mdash;alone!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Jovita (rushing towards him). No! no! You shall take ME! I have wronged
        you, Jack, cruelly; I have doubted you; but you shall not go alone. I
        care not for this contract! You are more to me, by your own right, Jack,
        than by any kinship with such as these!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst (raising her gently). I thank you, darling. But it is too late
        now. To be more worthy of you, to win YOU, I waived the title I had to
        you in my own manhood, to borrow another's more legal claim. I who would
        not win you as a gambler, cannot make you now the wife of a convicted
        impostor. No! Hear me, darling! do not make my disgrace greater than it
        is. In the years to come, Jovita, think of me as one who loved you well
        enough to go through shame to win you, but too well to ask you to share
        with him that shame. Farewell, darling, farewell! (Releases himself from
        JOVITA'S arms, who falls beside him.)
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho (rubbing his hands, and standing before him). Oho! Mr. John
        Oakhurst&mdash;eh&mdash;was it for this, eh&mdash;you leaped the garden
        wall, eh? was it for this you struck me down, eh? You are not wise, eh?
        You should have run away with the Dona when you could&mdash;ah, ah,
        impostor!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (leaping to his feet). Jack, you shall not go! I will go with you!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Oakhurst. No! Your place is there. (Pointing to old MORTON, whose head
        has sunk drunkenly on his breast.) Heed not this man; his tongue carries
        only the borrowed lash of his master.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. Eh! you are bold now&mdash;bold; but I said I would have revenge&mdash;ah,
        revenge!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (rushing toward him). Coward!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Hold your hand, sir! Hold! I allow no one to correct my
        menials but myself. Concho, order my carriage!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Concho. It is ready, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Don Jose. Then lead the way to it, for my daughter and her husband, John
        Oakhurst.&mdash;Good-night, Mr. Morton, I can sympathize with you; for
        we have both found a son. I am willing to exchange my dismissed servant
        for your dismissed PARTNER.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle (advancing). Ged, sir, I respect you! Ged, sir, permit me,
        sir, to grasp that honorable hand!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (excitedly). He is right, my partner. What have I done! The
        house of Morton &amp; Son dissolved. The man known as my partner&mdash;a
        fugitive! No, Alexander!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. One moment&mdash;a single moment! As a lawyer, permit me to
        say, sir, that the whole complication may be settled, sir, by the&mdash;er&mdash;addition
        of&mdash;er&mdash;single letter! The house of Morton &amp; Son shall
        hereafter read Morton &amp; Sons. The papers for the legal adoption of
        Mr. Oakhurst are&mdash;er&mdash;in my pocket.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton (more soberly). Have it your own way, sir! Morton &amp; Sons
        be it. Hark ye, Don Jose! We are equal at last. But&mdash;hark ye,
        Aleck! How about the boy, eh?&mdash;my grandson, eh? Is this one of the
        sons by adoption?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy (embarrassedly). It is my own, sir.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper (advancing). He can with safety claim it; for the mother is on
        her way to Australia with her husband.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. And the schoolma'am, eh?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Miss Mary. She will claim the usual year of probation for your prodigal,
        and then&mdash;
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Sandy. God bless ye, Miss Mary!
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. I am in a dream! But the world&mdash;my friends&mdash;my
        patrons&mdash;how can I explain?
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Starbottle. I will&mdash;er&mdash;explain. (Advancing slowly to front&mdash;to
        audience.) One moment&mdash;er&mdash;a single moment! If anything that
        has&mdash;er&mdash;transpired this evening&mdash;might seem to you,
        ladies and gentlemen&mdash;er&mdash;morally or&mdash;er&mdash;legally&mdash;or
        honorably to require&mdash;er&mdash;apology&mdash;or&mdash;er&mdash;explanation&mdash;permit
        me to say&mdash;that I&mdash;Col. Culpepper Starbottle, hold myself
        responsible&mdash;er&mdash;personally responsible.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Capper. Concho.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Old Morton. Sandy. Miss Mary. Don Jose. Jovita. Oakhurst.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        Col. Starbottle.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
